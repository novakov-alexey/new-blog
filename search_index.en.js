is one more optimization algorithm used in neural networks. It is based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. It has more hyper-parameters than classic Gradient Descent to tune externally\nGood default settings for the tested machine learning problems are:\n\nα =  0.001, // learning rate. We have already seen this one in classic Gradient Descent.\nβ1 = 0.9,\nβ2 = 0.999\neps = 10−8.\n\n\nValues on the right-hand side are proposed in the paper. However, you should tune them on your data, \nalso experiment with batch size and other parameters which may influence the Adam parameters.\nAlgorithm\nLet's look at original algorithm and then try to implement it in the code.\nAll operations on vectors are element-wise.  With β1t and β2t \nwe denote β1 and β2 to the power of t.\nRequire: α: Stepsize\nRequire: β1, β2 ∈[0,1): Exponential decay rates for the moment estimates\nRequire: f(θ): Stochastic objective function with parameters θ \nRequire: θ0: Initial parameter vector\nm0 ← 0 (Initialize 1st moment vector)\nv0 ← 0 (Initialize 2nd moment vector)\nt ← 0 (Initialize timestep)\nwhile θt not converged do \nt ← t + 1\ngt ← ∇θft (θt−1) (Get gradients w.r.t. stochastic objective at timestep t)\nmt ← β1 · mt−1 + (1−β1) · gt (Update biased first moment estimate)\nvt ← β2 · vt−1 + (1−β2) · g2t (Update biased second raw moment estimate)̂ \nmt ← mt / (1−βt1) (Compute bias-corrected first moment estimate)̂\nvt ← vt / (1−βt2) (Compute bias-corrected second raw moment estimate)\nθt ← θt−1−α·̂mt/(√̂vt +eps) (Update parameters)\nend while\nreturn θt (Resulting parameters)\nAt the last line we update parameters based on long chain of formulas which incorporate gradient and moments.\nImplementation\nChanges to existing library\nIn order to implement Adam for multi-layer neural network with backpropogation we will need to translate above algorithm to\nlinear algebra and Tensor API that we wrote in previous articles. Apart from that we would need to \nadd additional state to Layer type:\ncase class Layer[T](\n    w: Tensor[T],\n    b: Tensor[T],\n    f: ActivationFunc[T] = ActivationFuncApi.noActivation[T],\n    units: Int = 1,\n    state: Option[OptimizerState[T]] = None // additional property for an optimizer\n)\n\nWe assume that any optimizer may bring its own state apart of the usual weight and bias matrices, so we model \nnew property as trait and add implementation for Adam:\nsealed trait OptimizerState[T]\n\ncase class AdamState[T](\n    mw: Tensor[T], // 1st moment equal in shape to weight\n    vw: Tensor[T], // 2nd moment equal in shape to weight\n    mb: Tensor[T], // 1st moment equal in shape to bias\n    vb: Tensor[T]  // 2nd moment equal in shape to bias\n) extends OptimizerState[T]\n\nWe also need to initialise this state properties with zeros. For that, we extend layer construction code to let the optimizer type class\nto init its properties.\nFirst, we change add method in the Sequential type:\ndef add(layer: LayerCfg[T]): Sequential[T, U] =\n  copy(layerStack = (inputs) =&gt; {\n    val currentLayers = layerStack(inputs)\n    val prevInput = currentLayers.lastOption.map(_.units).getOrElse(inputs)\n    val w = random2D(prevInput, layer.units)\n    val b = zeros(layer.units)\n    // new line to init state for the chosen optimizer\n    val optimizerState = optimizer.initState(w, b) \n    (currentLayers :+ Layer(w, b, layer.f, layer.units, optimizerState))\n  })\n\nOptimizer trait now gets additional method:\n  def initState[T: ClassTag: Numeric](\n      w: Tensor[T], b: Tensor[T]\n  ): Option[OptimizerState[T]] = None\n\nAdam implementation for initState:\noverride def initState[T: ClassTag: Numeric](\n    w: Tensor[T], \n    b: Tensor[T]): Option[OptimizerState[T]] =\n  Some(AdamState[T](w.zero, w.zero, b.zero, b.zero))\n\nTensor.zero method creates new tensor with zeros using the same shape as original tensor.\nAlso, we need to keep Adam hyper-parameters somewhere. Let's create OptimizerCfg class and Adam extension in it.\nWe could design custom configuration nicely, for example, using traits, but I have decided to make it \"dirty\" at the moment:\ncase class OptimizerCfg[T: ClassTag: Fractional](\n  learningRate: T,\n  clip: GradientClipping[T] = GradientClippingApi.noClipping[T],\n  adam: AdamCfg[T]\n)\n\ncase class AdamCfg[T: ClassTag](b1: T, b2: T, eps: T)\nUpdate Weights using Adam\nWe now have all abstraction in place as well as all parameters to implement Adam optimizer.\nIn fact, first part to calculate gradient (partial derivative) will be the same as in classic gradient descent algorithm.\nSecond part will be Adam's own stuff:\noverride def updateWeights[T: ClassTag](\n  layers: List[Layer[T]],\n  activations: List[Activation[T]],\n  error: Tensor[T],\n  c: OptimizerCfg[T],\n  timestep: Int\n)(using n: Fractional[T]): List[Layer[T]] =\n  val AdamCfg(b1, b2, eps) = c.adam        \n\n  def correction(gradient: Tensor[T], m: Tensor[T], v: Tensor[T]) =        \n    val mt = (b1 * m) + ((n.one - b1) * gradient)\n    val vt = (b2 * v) + ((n.one - b2) * gradient.sqr)        \n    val mHat = mt :/ (n.one - (b1 ** timestep))\n    val vHat = vt :/ (n.one - (b2 ** timestep))            \n\n    val corr = c.learningRate *: (mHat / (vHat.sqrt + eps))\n    (corr, mt, vt)\n  \n  layers\n    .zip(activations)\n    .foldRight(\n      List.empty[Layer[T]],\n      error,\n      None: Option[Tensor[T]]          \n    ) {             \n      case (\n          (Layer(w, b, f, u, Some(AdamState(mw, vw, mb, vb))), Activation(x, z, _)),\n          (ls, prevDelta, prevWeight)\n        ) =&gt;            \n        val delta = (prevWeight match \n          case Some(pw) =&gt; prevDelta * pw.T\n          case None     =&gt; prevDelta\n        ) multiply f.derivative(z)        \n        val wGradient = c.clip(x.T * delta)\n        val bGradient = c.clip(delta).sum\n        \n        // Adam                        \n        val (corrW, weightM, weightV) = correction(wGradient, mw, vw)\n        val newWeight = w - corrW\n\n        val (corrB, biasM, biasV) = correction(bGradient.asT, mb, vb)\n        val newBias = b - corrB\n\n        val adamState = Some(AdamState(weightM, weightV, biasM, biasV))\n        val updated = Layer(newWeight, newBias, f, u, adamState) +: ls              \n        (updated, delta, Some(w))\n        \n      case s =&gt; sys.error(s\"Adam optimizer require state, but was:\\n$s\")\n    }\n    ._1    \n\nThe difference with classic gradient optimizer is:\n\ntimestep is an index across all training epochs and intermediate batches. Its range: [1 .. epochs * data.length / batchSize]\ncorrection function that goes after Adam paper to calculate final learning rate based on the weight or bias gradient.\nWe keep Adam moments for weight and bias AdamState as part of the Layer state across all learning epochs.\n\nThere is an extension to Tensor API I have added to support element-wise operations like:\n\ndivision def :/(that: T): Tensor[T]\nmultiplication (t: T) def *:(that: Tensor[T]): Tensor[T]\npower: def :**(to: Int): Tensor[T]\nsquare: def sqr: Tensor[T] = TensorOps.pow(t, 2)\nsqrt: def sqrt: Tensor[T] = TensorOps.sqrt(t)\n\nVisualisation\nWe are going to visualise Adam gradient trace to global minimum using Picta. So all we do is constructing ANN with Adam type parameter:\nval ann = Sequential[Double, Adam](\n    meanSquareError,\n    learningRate = 0.0012f,    \n    batchSize = 16,\n    gradientClipping = clipByValue(5.0d)\n  ).add(Dense())    \n\nLoss surface:\n\n\nAlso, we going to compare it on the same data with classic Gradient Descent:\n\n\nAdam gradient starts a bit differently then classic gradient descent. Eventually, they both converges at the same point.\nIf we compare the speed of finding global minimum, then on my data and on the same learning hyper-parameters, classic Gradient Descent is faster:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that orange line is slightly behind the blue one. Around 9th learning epoch they are both in the same position.\nSummary\nWe could easily extend existing library with one more optimizer such as Adam. It is quite popular optimizer nowadays as it shows\ngood result in the paper and in practise. Anyway, it did not show better results on my data comparing to classic gradient descent algorithm.\nMy experiment is not proving that Adam is not good, but it is just showing that in real life you need to experiment with \ndifferent weight optimisers. Also, you should tune hyper-parameters for each algorithm separately, i.e. reuse of the same hyper-parameters\nmight not help to get the best results out of another optimizer you are currently trying.\nLinks\n\nSource code - Optimizers\nReference Implementation for perceptron\nPaper: Adam: a method for stochastic optimization\nMXNET: Adam from scratch\n\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/adam-optimizer/","title":"Linear Regression with Adam Optimizer"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/algorithms-max-sum-in-array/":{"body":"Most of the algorithmic tasks are related to iterating over arrays of data. They often can be expressed as a function which takes some input and returns some single value or an array of values. For instance:\ndef maxSum(a: Array[Int]): Array[Int] = ???\n\nLet's solve next task using Scala's elegant and concise syntax.\nFind the max sum in the given array\nIt is one of the interesting task that I met first time at one of my past job 5 years ago. It was an internal meetup of developers learning new languages as well as training themselves in programming for fun.\nLater I use this task in Scala pet-project, called DevGym. Project idea was similar to well-known Codility web-site.\nTask\nThere is one array as input and another array as output. See test examples below:\n// Given\nArray(2, -4, 2, -1, 3, -3, 10, -1, -11, -100, 8, -1) \n\n// Then\n       Array(2, -1, 3, -3, 10)\n\n2 - 1 + 3 - 3 + 10 = 11\nSince 11 is the max sum we could find within the input array\n//Given\nArray(-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4)\n//Then\n           Array(4, -1, 2, 1)\n\n4 - 1 + 2 + 1 = 6\n6 is the max sum.\nSolution\nIn general, we can solve this problem in O(n) complexity. By using intermediate variables to \naccumulate current sum as well as max sum, we can find left and right indices, which can be used\nto return a sub-array.\ndef maxSum(a: Array[Int]): Array[Int] = {\n  var currentSum = 0\n  var maxSum = 0\n  var left, right, maxLeft, maxRight = 0\n  var maxI = 0 //used when all negatives in the array\n\n  for (i &lt;- a.indices) {\n    currentSum += a(i)\n\n    if (currentSum &gt; 0) {    \n      // in case current sum is getting greater,\n      // then we found next right index with the max sum so far\n      if (currentSum &gt; maxSum) {        \n        maxSum = currentSum\n        right = i\n        maxRight = right\n        maxLeft = left\n      }\n    } else {\n      // in case new sum is lower than or equal 0, \n      // then we need to move left and right index further  \n      // and continue the search\n      left = i + 1\n      right = left\n      currentSum = 0\n      if (a(i) &gt; a(maxI)) maxI = i\n    }\n  }\n  // at this point we found left and right\n  // indices to capture sub-array with max sum\n  if (maxLeft == a.length) Array(a(maxI))\n  else a.slice(maxLeft, maxRight + 1)\n}\n\nAbove algorithm can be even shorter, if we return only final sum, i.e. without tracking left and right indices.\nSummary\nScala is a nice language to solve different algorithmic tasks.

Ammonite project consists of a REPL, script launcher and a few Scala libraries.\nLet’s write a script to generate JSON data and send it to Apache Kafka topic.\nCreate scripts\nWe are going to create two scripts. One script will be importing another script definitions. \nIn this case will be able to organise our code in modules. Even short scripts may become complex and should be a bit organised for better code maintenance.\nFirst Script - Generate Data\ntouch common.sc\n\nThis script imports two libraries:\n\nscalacheck for data generation\ncirce to format case classes to JSON text\n\nimport $ivy.`org.scalacheck::scalacheck:1.14.3`\nimport $ivy.`io.circe::circe-generic:0.13.0`\n\nimport io.circe.generic.auto._, io.circe.syntax._\nimport org.scalacheck.Gen\n\ncase class Sensor(number: Int, lat: Double, lon: Double, address: String)\ncase class Event(time: Long, temperature: Float, sensor: Sensor)\n\nval sensor1 = Sensor(1, -75.5712, -130.5355, \"123 Main St, LAX, CA\")\nval sensor2 = Sensor(2, -48.8712, -151.6866, \"456 Side St, SFO, CA\")\nval sensors = Gen.oneOf(sensor1, sensor2)\nval temperature = Gen.choose(21f, 25f)\n\ndef genEvent =\n  for {\n    s &lt;- sensors\n    t &lt;- temperature\n  } yield Event(System.currentTimeMillis(), t, s)\n\ndef genBatch(size: Int = 10) =\n  for {\n    events &lt;- Gen.listOfN(size, genEvent)\n    dataBatch = events.map(_.asJson.noSpaces)\n  } yield dataBatch\n\ngenBatch is main function in this script to be used by another/main script. It generates List[String] as return value. \nEvery string in the list is a JSON text to be sent to Kafka topic.\nSecond Script - Send Data\ntouch kafka-producer.sc\n\nAdd below Scala code statements to import Kafka library, Scala, Java classes into our script\n// file import explained later \nimport $file.common\n// Ammonite imports library automatically!\nimport $ivy.`org.apache.kafka:kafka-clients:1.0.0`\n\nimport common._\nimport org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.Producer\nimport org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord\nimport org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer\nimport org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerConfig\nimport org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.LongSerializer\nimport org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer\nimport java.util.Properties\nimport java.io.FileReader\nimport java.io.File\nimport scala.annotation.tailrec\nimport scala.util.Using\nimport scala.io.Source\n\nIn order to make this script executable we need to annotate one of the method by @main annotation:\n@main\ndef main(topicName: String, delay: Int = 1000) = {\n  // create producer properties\n  val configFile = new File(\"./producer.properties\")\n  val props = new Properties()\n  Using.resource(new FileReader(configFile)) { reader =&gt;\n    props.load(reader)\n  }\n  val bootstrapFile = \"bootstrap-servers.txt\"\n  val servers = Using.resource(Source.fromFile(bootstrapFile)) {\n    file =&gt;\n      file.getLines.toList.headOption\n        .getOrElse(sys.error(s\"$bootstrapFile file is empty!\"))\n        .trim\n  }\n  props.put(\n    \"bootstrap.servers\",\n    servers\n  )\n  props.put(ProducerConfig.CLIENT_ID_CONFIG, \"KafkaExampleProducer\")\n  props.put(\n    ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG,\n    classOf[LongSerializer].getName\n  )\n  props.put(\n    ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG,\n    classOf[StringSerializer].getName\n  )\n  props.put(ProducerConfig.ACKS_CONFIG, \"all\");\n \n  // create producer\n  val producer = new KafkaProducer[Long, String](props)\n \n  // send data to Kafka\n  sendData(producer, topicName, delay)\n}\n\nIn the main function we use regular Scala code to:\n\nread producer properties\nread Kafka broker/bootstrap hostnames\ncreate KafkaProducer using Java Kafka library API\nsend data to Kafka topic infinitely \n\nAbove main function can be executed now via:\namm kafka-producer.sc --topicName test --delay 1000\n\nHowever, it won't compile until we add sendData function.\n@tailrec\ndef sendData(\n    producer: Producer[Long, String],\n    topic: String,\n    delay: Int\n): Unit = {\n  genBatch().sample.get.foreach { json =&gt;\n    println(json)\n    val record = new ProducerRecord(topic, System.currentTimeMillis(), json)\n    producer.send(\n      record,\n      (metadata, ex) =&gt; {\n        Option(ex).foreach { t =&gt;\n          throw new RuntimeException(s\"Failed to send the data: $json\", t)\n        }\n      }\n    )\n  }\n  Thread.sleep(delay)\n  sendData(producer, topic, delay)\n}\n\nsendData is calling genBatch() function from the first script common.sc. We imported all definitions from that script via import common._.\nAmmonite script launcher compiles all imported scripts automatically, so we need to import it only.\nIn the sendData function we generate List of JSON strings to send them via Kafka producer. In case we get an exception in producer's response, we\nthrow an exception to stop the script execution. In case there is no exception thrown by the Kafka producer, then sendData is \nsending data to Kafka topic again and again sleeping in between with the user given delay in milliseconds.\nExecute Script\nBefore we execute above script, we need to have two configuration files for Kafka Producer.\ntouch producer.properties\n\nFor example, I have the following properties. In your case, you will have some of them or none of them (if you rely on default Kafka\nproducer properties):\n# this file content is auto-generated by get-jks.sh\nssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm=\nssl.truststore.location=./ssl/producer.truststore.jks\nssl.truststore.password=&lt;your trustore password if any&gt;\nssl.keystore.location=./ssl/producer.keystore.jks\nssl.keystore.password=&lt;your key password if any&gt;\nssl.key.password=&lt;your key password if any&gt;\nsasl.mechanism=GSSAPI\nsasl.kerberos.service.name=kafka\nsecurity.protocol=SASL_SSL\nsasl.jaas.config=com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required \\\n    useKeyTab=true \\\n    storeKey=true \\\n    useTicketCache=false \\\n    keyTab=\"./client.keytab\" \\\n    principal=\"my-test@EXAMPLE.COM\";\n\n\nAnother file that we used in the main script is file with Kafka broker hostnames. Put your broker hostname(s) or IP address(es) separaing by coma:\n&lt;hostname of the broker 1&gt;,&lt;hostname of the broker 2&gt;....\n\nFinally, if we run the main script, it will start to print the JSON data that is sent to Kafka topic:\namm kafka-producer.sc --topicName test --delay 1000\nCompiling ~/kafka-produce.sc\n{\"time\":1606601101634,\"temperature\":21.944403,\"sensor\":{\"number\":2,\"lat\":-48.8712,\"lon\":-151.6866,\"address\":\"456 Side St, SFO, CA\"}}\n{\"time\":1606601101635,\"temperature\":24.016523,\"sensor\":{\"number\":1,\"lat\":-75.5712,\"lon\":-130.5355,\"address\":\"123 Main St, LAX, CA\"}}\n{\"time\":1606601101635,\"temperature\":24.302032,\"sensor\":{\"number\":2,\"lat\":-48.8712,\"lon\":-151.6866,\"address\":\"456 Side St, SFO, CA\"}}\n{\"time\":1606601101635,\"temperature\":24.295887,\"sensor\":{\"number\":2,\"lat\":-48.8712,\"lon\":-151.6866,\"address\":\"456 Side St, SFO, CA\"}}\n{\"time\":1606601101635,\"temperature\":24.507029,\"sensor\":{\"number\":2,\"lat\":-48.8712,\"lon\":-151.6866,\"address\":\"456 Side St, SFO, CA\"}}\n{\"time\":1606601101636,\"temperature\":24.488947,\"sensor\":{\"number\":1,\"lat\":-75.5712,\"lon\":-130.5355,\"address\":\"123 Main St, LAX, CA\"}}\n.....\nSummary\nIf you want to use Scala for scripting purposes, you can easily do that with Ammonite Scripts.\nIt allows you to import any JVM library from Sonatype public repository. \nAmmonite can be also configured to search any other public or private Maven, Ivy repositories. \nAnother cool feature of Ammonite Scripts is local file imports. That allows to write many scripts and organise them in modules, reuse them in many places.\nCode editor like VSCode and IntelliJ IDE support Ammonite Scripts well, so that you can benefit from auto-completion and \"go to definition\" features while writing your code \nwith Ammonite Scripts.\nStandard Scala SDK can also execute Scala file .scala as shell script. \nOne needs to add a special directive at the top of the file, so that the file will be executed via Scala compiler. However, in this way, you can't download some library like Ammonite does.\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ammonite-kafka/","title":"Ammonite Kafka Producer"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ann-in-scala-1/":{"body":"\n\nDeep Learning is a group of machine learning methods which are based on artificial neural networks. Some of the deep learning architectures are deep neural networks.\nDeep neural network is an artificial neural network (ANN further) with multiple layers between the input and output layers. There are different types of neural networks, but they always have\nneurons, synapses, weights, biases and functions.\n\n\nScala is a full-stack multi-paradigm programming language. Scala is famous for its innovations in JVM eco-system and\nambitious language syntax features leaving all other JVM-based languages for years behind. \nScala is also popular language thanks to Apache Spark, Kafka and Flink projects which are mainly implemented in it. \nScope\nThis tutorial is divided into 2 articles. \n\n\nIn this article we will go through the theory of ANN implementation. I will guide you through the basic calculus such as linear algebra and a little bit of differential calculus, which you need to know to implement neural network training and optimization algorithms.\n\n\nIn the second aritcle we are going to implement ANN from scratch in Scala. \nYou can jump into second part directly, if you are familiar with the theory. But first look at the ANN Jargon table, if you decided to switch to second part.\n\n\nANN Jargon\nI assume you are a bit familiar with Machine Learning or Deep Learning. Nevertheless, below table will be useful to match \nDeep Learning terminology with further Scala implementation. Some of the variable names in Scala code will be directly based \non the Deep learning name definitions, so that it is important to know why some variable is named as z and another one as w.\nCode Symbol / TypeDescriptionEncoded as\nxinput data for each neuron2-dimensional tensor, i.e. matrix\ny , actualtarget data we know in advance from the training dataset1-d tensor, i.e. vector\nyHat , predictedoutput of the neural network during the training or single prediction1-d tensor\nwlayer weight, a.k.a model parameters2-d tensor\nblayer bias, part of the layer parameters1-d tensor\nzlayer activation, calculated as  x * w + b2-d tensor\nfactivation function to activate neuron.

Tensor in computer science is a generic abstraction for N-dimensional array. \nIn our ANN implementation, we are going to use scalar numbers which are encoded as 0-dimension tensor, vector - encoded as 1-d tensor and\nfinally matrix - encoded as 2-d tensor. Vector and matrix are the most used building blocks for Deep Learning calculus. All tensor shapes we will\nuse are going to be rectangular - every element is the same size along each axis.\nDataset\nWe will take _Churn Modelling dataset which predicts whether a customer is going to leave the bank or not. \nThis dataset is traveling across many tutorials at the Internet, \nso that you can find a couple different code implementations among dozens of articles using the same data, so do I.\nRowNumber,CustomerId,Surname,CreditScore,Geography,Gender,Age,Tenure,Balance,NumOfProducts,HasCrCard,IsActiveMember,EstimatedSalary,Exited\n1,15634602,Hargrave,619,France,Female,42,2,0,1,1,1,101348.88,1\n2,15647311,Hill,608,Spain,Female,41,1,83807.86,1,0,1,112542.58,0\n3,15619304,Onio,502,France,Female,42,8,159660.8,3,1,0,113931.57,1\n4,15701354,Boni,699,France,Female,39,1,0,2,0,0,93826.63,0\n\nThe last column is y, i.e. the value we want our ANN to predict between 0 and 1. Rest of the columns are x data, also known as features. We drop \nfirst 3 columns and the last column y before we use them as x matrix. Remaining columns:\nCreditScore,\nGeography,\nGender,\nAge,\nTenure,\nBalance,\nNumOfProducts,\nHasCrCard,\nIsActiveMember,\nEstimatedSalary\nNetwork Topology\n\n\nAbove picture describes a network we are going to implement.\n\n\nN is a number of features, i.e. remaining columns from the input dataset.\n\n\nEach layer is fully connected with next layer. I draw each layer by skipping middle neurons to get smaller visual overhead.\n\n\nBetween each layer we have weights which form linear equations via dot product x * w + bias.\n\n\nEach layer has its own activation functions. We use ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and Sigmoid functions.\n\n\nForward Propagation\nBasic idea of neural network implementation is to leverage math principals for matrix and vector multiplication. As neural network is going to be fully connected from layer to layer, we can represent learning and optimization algorithms as following:\nDimensions\nSingle training example\nIt is one data record:\n\nx: 12 input columns as 1 x 12 matrix\nw1: 12 x 6 matrix + 6 x 1 matrix for biases\nw2: 6 x 6 matrix + 6 x 1 matrix for biases\nw3: 6 x 1 matrix + 1 x 1 matrix for biases\nyHat: scalar number\n\nAn amount of hidden layers and neurons are parameters to be tuned by an expert, i.e. externally to the main algorithm. \nWe set 2 hidden layers with 6 neurons each. Our last layer\nis single neuron that produces final prediction, which we will treat as yes or no to answer customer churn question.\nMultiple training examples\nMini-batch approach, i.e. multiple training examples at once. Batch size to be tuned externally as well. Let's take 16 as batch size:\n\nx: 16 x 12 matrix\nw1: 12 x 6 matrix + 6 x 1 matrix for biases\nw2: 6 x 6 matrix + 6 x 1 matrix for biases\nw3: 6 x 1 matrix + 1 x 1 matrix for biases\nyHat: 16 x 1 matrix\n\nAs you can see, our matrices are equal in rows at input and output layers.\nThat means we can input any number of rows through the neural network at once when we do training or prediction.\nMath of the Forward propagation\nWhen we train neural network, we use input data and parameters on all hidden layers to reach output layer, so that we get the prediction value(s).\nFirst part of the ANN implementation that calculates predictions, i.e. yHat is called _forward propagation.\nLinear algebra helps us to feed data into the network and get the result using matrix multiplication principals. That makes the entire training and single\nprediction quite generic, so that we can easily program that in any programming language. \nIn a nutshell, our 12 x 6 x 6 x 1 network will form the following expressions for every training batch:\nFirst Hidden Layer\n\n\nAbove picture shows activations for the neurons of the first hidden layer. In fact, next layers are calculated in similar way.\n\n\nX is a matrix where each row is a data sample. Every column is a particular feature/column from the initial dataset. Usually, input column is scaled/encoded (see second article).\n\n\nWe use dot product operation for X and W. \nResulting matrix is used to add biases using element-wise addition. b1 will be added to each element of the first row of that resulting matrix,\nthen b2 to the second row and so on.\n\n\nSecond Hidden Layer\nThe x of the second layer is an a we calculated on the previous layer. We will call it a1.\na1 (16 x 6) * w2 (6 x 6) + b2 (6 x 1) = z2 (16 x 6)\n\nf(z2) = a2 (16 x 6)\n\nAbove pseudo-code shows matrix dimensions in the parenthesis.\nOutput Layer\nInput data is a2. Here we get out prediction at the end:\na2 (16 x 6) * w3 (6 x 1) + b3 (1 x 1) = z3 (16 x 1)\n\nf(z3) = a3 (16 x 1)\n\na3 a.k.a yHat represents a prediction for each data sample in the batch. Prediction values are probabilities between 0 and 1. \nIf you are confused with above explanation, I recommend to check great video series on Deep Learning: But what is a Neural Network? | Deep learning, chapter 1.\nBatch Tracing\nIn order to see what is going on with the state of neural network, let's feed one single batch into it.\nThere are different strategies for initial weights and biases initialisation. In our implementation we will follow:\n\nweight matrices are initialised using uniform-random\nbias vectors are initialised with zeros\n\nLater they will be updated via optimization algorithm.\nx - input\nBelow matrix is our x, which is our input data from the training or test set.

You should not try understand these digits in weights, biases and outputs matrices.\nThey are going to change their values a lot after running training loop 100 times (epochs) with N batches each.\nBackward Propagation\nInitial weights and biases are not going to give us right equations to predict our y. Even if we propagate the entire dataset through the network.\nObviously, someone needs to update these parameters based on some feedback. This feedback is calculated via loss function. \nIn the science literature, loss function is also called as cost function. We are going to use loss and cost here as synonymous.\nThere are different loss functions in Deep Learning we can use. We will go with binary-cross-entropy as we predict binary value. \nOur loss value will show how good we are updating the network weights at specific training epoch. However, updates will be done using Gradient\nDescent optimization algorithm.\nGradient Descent optimization\nModel prediction is calculated through the forward propagation of the input data sample(s). \nIf weights and biases are trained well, then our predictions will be accurate as well. In order to say whether our model performs well,\nwe check loss value on every training cycle as well as accuracy metric. Accuracy is number of correct predictions divided by total number of data samples during the training or validation.\nYou might ask yourself - how can I train model parameters well? In other words how to update them in right direction, so that they give accurate predictions? \nHere we meet Gradient Descent.\nAs per Wikipedia:\n\n  Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function\n  \n\nGradient descent is a way to minimise an objective loss function for neural network parameters. In other words, it helps to find best parameters by\nminimising loss function. Smaller loss, better overall network accuracy.\nUsing Gradient Descent, we are finding proper change rate on every training cycle. \nSo that we can update our weights and biases to get the best model performance. \nHow exactly the Gradient Descent algorithm calculates that change?\nThere are thousands of articles explaining that visually. In short, we are trying to find steepest descent of the derivative function.\nUsing small coefficient learningRate we subtract the gradient value from the initial parameter. That allows us to find best parameter and\nminimise the loss function. One of the good visual explanation for linear regression problem with gradient descent is here. It also works well for multiple linear regression like in our case, we got 12 features, so 12 independent variables.\nComing back to our back-propagation implementation. f'(x)is a derivative function of the layer's activation function. We use derivative function to update all weights except the last one, i.e. w1 and w2, not w3. To update w3, we use delta based on the error, i.e. predicted - actual. \nLayers w1 and w2 are using relu as activation function. Derivative of the relu function is following:\nif (x &lt; 0) 0 \nelse 1\n\nSuch derivative function is applied element-wise to z matrix in the step #6 of the back propagation part (see second article for Scala reference implementation).\nMath of the Backward propagation\nBack-propagation part of ANN is a bit more complicated than forward propagation part. \nIn Gradient Descent Optimization algorithm, we calculate derivatives to calculate yHat rate of change with respect to last z, in our case it is z3. \nHigh-level steps of the Gradient Descent algorithm\n\nCalculate error based on actual y and on predicted yHat. It will be called delta further and in the code.\n\ndelta = (yHat - y) multiply f'(z)\n\nresult is a 16 x 1 matrix\n\nwhere:\n    - \"f`\" is a derivative to activation function on the current layer.   \n    - \"z\" is current layer activation.\n    - \"multiply\" is Hadamard product, a.k.a. element-wise multiplication. \n      Note: it is not the same as dot product.\n\n\nIterate list of weights matrices from end to start, i.e. backwards.\nLet's take \"i\" as layer index\nCalculate partial derivative as:\n\n partialDerivativeN = xi.T * delta\n\n where:     \n     - \"T\" is a matrix transpose operation,\n     - \"*\" is dot product operation.    \n\n\nUpdate weights of i layer via:\n\nwi = wi - learningRate * partialDerivative_i \n\nwhere:\n  - \"learningRate\" is a scalar number. \n  - \"partialDerivative_i\" is a matrix, so \"*\" is dot product here as well.\n\n\nUpdate bias of i layer via:\n\nbi = bi - sum(delta)\n\n\n\nPass updated weight wi and delta to previous layer, i.e. to wi - 1.\n\n\nNow starting wi - 1 weight update, we calculate delta differently.\n\n\ndelta = (previousDelta * previousW) multiply f'(z)\n\nwhere:\n   - \"previousDelta\" is delta from previous step, i.e. \n      it is from layer next to the right, because we go backward. \n   - \"previousW\" - is a weight matrix from the previous step as well.\n\nIf i &gt; 0, then:\ndecrement i via i = i -1 and then repeat steps from 2 to 5. \notherwise: \nwe finished back-propagation for a specific batch or a single data sample (in case of stochastic gradient descent).\nBack-propagation tracing\nw3 - between 2nd hidden and output layers\nDelta (error):\nsizes: 16, Tensor1D[Float]:\n[-0.5,0.5,-2.336502E-5,0.5,0.99982685,0.0,1.0,-0.27220798,0.9981591,0.99999166,0.5142617,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.9999994]\n\nx transpose:\nsizes: 6x16, Tensor2D[Float]:\n[[0.0,0.0,2.3540525,0.0,1.1964836,4.380693,6.6140265,0.44490784,1.8534858,2.7576103,0.007678177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0259452]\n [0.0,0.0,1.4293345,0.0,1.9171724,5.341193,5.351874,0.52522117,1.888961,3.053475,0.0014958136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.647504]\n [0.0,0.0,2.901132,0.0,3.4634292,6.8469305,9.681695,0.16261059,1.7458743,4.406227,0.0116603775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.5064058]\n [0.0,0.0,2.2631726,0.0,1.4329143,5.5888605,7.362318,0.16618003,1.1314285,2.040889,0.023946803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.7598464]\n [0.0,0.0,3.2273922,0.0,2.8001034,8.964131,10.323663,0.10813884,1.4567397,2.918638,0.013493502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6922505]\n [0.0,0.0,3.2367752,0.0,2.513441,9.055562,10.566048,0.26056617,1.7771944,3.133051,0.015981253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.64655]]\n\npartialDerivative3 = x.T * (delta multiply f`(z)):\nsizes: 6x1, Tensor2D[Float]:\n[[15.326693]\n [16.712915]\n [22.761444]\n [14.692074]\n [21.16563]\n [22.569763]]\n\nupdated Weight = w - learningRate * partialDerivative3 :\nsizes: 6x1, Tensor2D[Float]:\n[[0.6776238]\n [0.29685247]\n [0.496793]\n [0.95105153]\n [0.824897]\n [0.64518374]]\n\nupdated Bias = b - learningRate * sum(delta) :\nsizes: 1, Tensor1D[Float]:\n[-0.0077400077]\nw2 - between 1st and 2nd hidden layers\ncurrent delta:\ndelta (16x6) = (previous delta * previous w) multiply f`(z)\n\ncurrent derivative:\npartialDerivative2 (6 x 6) = x.T (6 x 16) * delta (16 x 6)\n\nupdated Weight:\nw2 (6x6) = w2 (6x6) - learningRate * partialDerivative2 (6 x 6)\n\nupdated Bias:\nb2 (6 x 1) = b2 (6 x 1) - learningRate * sum(delta)\nw1 - between input and 1st hidden layers\ncurrent delta:\ndelta (16x6) = (previous delta * previous w) multiply f`(z)\n\ncurrent derivative:\npartialDerivative1 (12 x 6) = x.T (12 x 16) * delta (16 x 6)\n\nupdated Weight:\nw1 (12x6) = w2 (12x6) - learningRate * partialDerivative1 (12 x 6)\n\nupdated Bias:\nb1 (6 x 1) = b1 (6 x 1) - learningRate * sum(delta)\nWrapping up\nWe have finished with theoretical part and ready to continue with the second article ANN in Scala: implementation.\nIn case you have not gotten how the ANN is actually working in theory, then I encourage you to search for other articles and \nvideos.

Without these operations, we will clutter the\nmain algorithm so that another person, who will be reading our code, may lost. It is very easy to be blown\naway by pile of code which is trying to mimic math. Scala is perfect language to implement math expression as\nit supports custom operands by using symbols as definitions (variables, methods, etc.), i.e. we can implement \"*\" or any other math operations as part of our custom type Tensor.\nBelow we define Tensor trait for a generic type T.

Of course, we could implement\ntensors in more generic way and invent some N-dimensional array that would support 3, 4 and any number of dimensions,\nbut I think from our personal learning perspective, making more concrete hard-coded classes would be easier to understand the whole ANN \nimplementation.\nMatmul\nLet's look only at one important operation from Tensor API which is dot product.\ndef mul[T: ClassTag: Numeric](a: Tensor[T], b: Tensor[T]): Tensor[T] =\n  (a, b) match\n    case (Tensor0D(data), t) =&gt;\n      scalarMul(t, data)\n    case (t, Tensor0D(data)) =&gt;\n      scalarMul(t, data)\n    case (Tensor1D(data), Tensor2D(data2)) =&gt;\n      Tensor2D(matMul(asColumn(data), data2))\n    case (Tensor2D(data), Tensor1D(data2)) =&gt;\n      Tensor2D(matMul(data, asColumn(data2)))\n    case (Tensor1D(data), Tensor1D(data2)) =&gt;\n      Tensor1D(matMul(asColumn(data), Array(data2)).head)\n    case (Tensor2D(data), Tensor2D(data2)) =&gt;\n      Tensor2D(matMul(data, data2))\n\n  private def matMul[T: ClassTag: Numeric](\n      a: Array[Array[T]],\n      b: Array[Array[T]]\n  )(using n: Numeric[T]): Array[Array[T]] =\n    assert(\n      a.head.length == b.length,\n      \"The number of columns in the first matrix should be equal \" + \n      s\"to the number of rows in the second, ${a.head.length} != ${b.length}\"\n    )\n    val rows = a.length\n    val cols = colsCount(b)\n    val res = Array.ofDim[T](rows, cols)\n\n    for i &lt;- (0 until rows).indices do\n      for j &lt;- (0 until cols).indices do\n        var sum = n.zero\n        for k &lt;- b.indices do\n          sum = sum + (a(i)(k) * b(k)(j))\n        res(i)(j) = sum\n    res    \n\n\nFirst we select specific type of multiplication based on the tensor dimension. \nIf tensor is not scalar, then we try to use matrix multiplication. Here, if some of the operands is vector we make that vector as matrix\nwith one column according to math convention. \nLater we check operands dimensions, as they must obey rules of\nmatrix multiplication. If rules are not met we throw an error. No Scala Either type or other error modelling is used to not clutter the code. Our goal is to stay as close as possible to math and keep balance between using types and readability.\n\nSee source code on GitHub for full implementation of tensor library.\nNeural Network DSL\nLet's define a trait for abstract model that can learn:\nsealed trait Model[T]:\n  def train(x: Tensor[T], y: Tensor[T], epochs: Int): Model[T]\n  def predict(x: Tensor[T]): Tensor[T]\n  def reset(): Model[T]\n  def currentWeights: List[Weight[T]]\n  def losses: List[T]\n\nThe first two methods are the main ones. \n\nWe can use train to provide input features as x and target values as y, specify\nnumber of training cycles as epochs to learn the right parameters for future predictions.\npredict allows us to infer target value by giving only x data\nreset cleans model weights, so that it initialises them again upon next training\ncurrentWeights and losses are returning weights and losses of the last training cycle.\n\nMachine learning model is a stateful thing. It keeps list of parameters called weights and biases of type List[Weight[T]].\nThese parameters are the heart of the model. They are mutating on every training epoch and data batch.\nModel initialisation\nBefore designing neural network training API, let's look at entities we need:\ntrait ActivationFunc[T]:\n  def apply(x: Tensor[T]): Tensor[T]\n  def derivative(x: Tensor[T]): Tensor[T]\n\ntrait Loss[T]:\n  def apply(actual: Tensor[T], predicted: Tensor[T]): T\n\nsealed trait Layer[T]:\n  def units: Int\n  def f: ActivationFunc[T]\n\ncase class Dense[T](f: ActivationFunc[T], units: Int = 1) extends Layer[T]\n\ncase class Weight[T](\n  w: Tensor[T], b: Tensor[T], \n  f: ActivationFunc[T], units: Int\n)\n\n/*\n * z - before activation = w * x\n * a - activation value\n */\ncase class Activation[T](x: Tensor[T], z: Tensor[T], a: Tensor[T])\n\nWe have modelled network parameters as traits with implementations as case classes. Later we use \nthem to create an instance of the model.\ntrait RandomGen[T]:\n  def gen: T\n\ncase class Sequential[T: ClassTag: RandomGen: Numeric, U: Optimizer](\n    lossFunc: Loss[T],\n    learningRate: T,\n    metric: Metric[T],\n    batchSize: Int = 16,\n    weightStack: Int =&gt; List[Weight[T]] = (_: Int) =&gt; List.empty[Weight[T]],    \n    weights: List[Weight[T]] = Nil,\n    losses: List[T] = Nil\n) extends Model[T]:\n\n  def add(layer: Layer[T]): Sequential[T, U] =\n    copy(weightStack = (inputs) =&gt; {\n      val currentWeights = weightStack(inputs)\n      val prevInput =\n        currentWeights.reverse.headOption.map(_.units).getOrElse(inputs)\n      val w = random2D(prevInput, layer.units)\n      val b = zeros(layer.units)\n      (currentWeights :+ Weight(w, b, layer.f, layer.units))\n    })\n\nThere are bunch of parameters that we need in simple sequential model with fully connected layers:\n\nGeneric type T is numeric type of the data which can be Float, Double, Int, etc. Most of the time you want numbers with floating point in machine learning.\nRandom generator can be provided as contextual abstraction (given instance). It is used to initialise\nweights and biases for every layer.\nGeneric U is a type of optimisation algorithm that we use in back-propagation part of the training cycle. Also given as type class instance.\nlearningRate and batchSize are hyper-parameters to be tuned externally.\nweightStack is a function that construct list of initial layers based on the provided earlier Layer configuration via\nmethod add.  It is not supposed to be called manually. The weightStack function is called by train \nmethod internally to create initial list of weights, if weights are empty. If they \nare not empty, they are reused.\n\nThis is how a user is supposed to use such API:\nval accuracy = accuracyMetric[Float]\n  \nval ann = Sequential[Float, SimpleGD](\n  binaryCrossEntropy,\n  learningRate = 0.05f,\n  metric = accuracy,\n  batchSize = 32\n)\n  .add(Dense(relu, 6))\n  .add(Dense(relu, 6))    \n  .add(Dense(sigmoid))\n\nThere is a type SimpleGD that picks up a required instance of Optimizer implementation. See details below.\nTraining loop\ntrain method runs trainEpoch multiple times, which is equal to epochs parameter. \nEvery training epoch returns new weights list, which is used again for the next epoch. This loop may run, for example, 100 times.\nAlso, we collect a list of average loss values and print a user metric value. We have set accuracy metric as per code earlier.\ndef train(x: Tensor[T], y: Tensor[T], epochs: Int): Model[T] =\n  lazy val inputs = x.cols\n  lazy val actualBatches = y.batches(batchSize).toArray\n  lazy val xBatches = x.batches(batchSize).zip(actualBatches).toArray\n  lazy val w = getWeights(inputs)\n\n  val (updatedWeights, epochLosses) =\n    (1 to epochs).foldLeft((w, List.empty[T])) {\n      case ((weights, losses), epoch) =&gt;\n        val (w, avgLoss, metricValue) = trainEpoch(xBatches, weights)\n        val metricAvg = metric.average(x.length, metricValue)\n        println(\n          s\"epoch: $epoch/$epochs, avg. loss: $avgLoss, \n          ${metric.name}: $metricAvg\"\n        )\n        (w, losses :+ avgLoss)\n    }\n  copy(weights = updatedWeights, losses = epochLosses)\n\ntrainEpoch is implementing forward- and back-propagation for every data sample batch:\nprivate def trainEpoch(\n    batches: Array[(Array[Array[T]], Array[Array[T]])],\n    weights: List[Weight[T]]\n) =\n  val (w, l, metricValue) =\n    batches.foldLeft(weights, List.empty[T], 0) {\n      case ((weights, batchLoss, metricAcc), (xBatch, yBatch)) =&gt;\n        // forward\n        val activations = activate(xBatch.as2D, weights)\n        val actual = yBatch.as2D          \n        val predicted = activations.last.a          \n        val error = predicted - actual          \n        val loss = lossFunc(actual, predicted)\n\n        // backward\n        val updated = summon[Optimizer[U]].updateWeights(\n          weights,\n          activations,\n          error,\n          learningRate\n        )\n        val metricValue = metric.calculate(actual, predicted)\n        (updated, batchLoss :+ loss, metricAcc + metricValue)\n    }    \n  (w, getAvgLoss(l), metricValue)\nGradient Descent Optimizer\nNow let's look at optimizer code. It implements standard gradient descent algorithm:\nsealed trait Optimizer[U]:\n  def updateWeights[T: Numeric: ClassTag](\n    weights: List[Weight[T]],\n    activations: List[Activation[T]],\n    error: Tensor[T],\n    learningRate: T\n  ): List[Weight[T]]\n\ntype SimpleGD\n\nIn order to update weights an optimizer needs:\n\nthe list of weights to update\ncurrent activations for all layers\ncalculated error: yHat vs. y\nlearningRate parameter, which is static for the entire training cycle\n\nSimpleGD type is a token to summon an optimizer instance. In future, we can extend optimizers with other algorithms.\nData batching is happening outside of the optimizer, in the train method.\nWe can select either full batch or mini-batch training by specifying a number of records in the batch. \nSo that is why this optimizer is not specific type of gradient descent (stochastic, mini-batch, batch), but just works with \nwhatever weights are given for updates.\nActual implementation of the gradient descent optimization:\ngiven Optimizer[SimpleGD] with\n  override def updateWeights[T: Numeric: ClassTag](\n      weights: List[Weight[T]],\n      activations: List[Activation[T]],\n      error: Tensor[T],\n      learningRate: T\n  ): List[Weight[T]] =      \n    weights\n      .zip(activations)\n      .foldRight(\n        List.empty[Weight[T]],\n        error,\n        None: Option[Tensor[T]]\n      ) {\n        case (\n              (Weight(w, b, f, u), Activation(x, z, _)),\n              (ws, prevDelta, prevWeight)\n            ) =&gt;            \n          val delta = (prevWeight match {\n            case Some(pw) =&gt; prevDelta * pw.T\n            case None     =&gt; prevDelta\n          }) multiply f.derivative(z)\n\n          val partialDerivative = x.T * delta\n          val newWeight = w - (learningRate * partialDerivative)\n          val newBias = b - (learningRate * delta.sum)\n          val updated = Weight(newWeight, newBias, f, u) +: ws\n          (updated, delta, Some(w))\n      }\n      ._1\n\nThe weights update starts from tail and moves to the head of the list, i.e. from the last layer to the first hidden layer.\nweights and activations are equal in length, since the last one is produced via the weight list during the forward-propagation. \nThe complex part is calculating the delta that we use for partial derivative. \n\nInitial delta is equal to error. Next layer is calculating delta on its own, which is a dot product of previous layer delta and weights.\nLast layer does not have previous weights.\nEvery delta is then multiplied by activation function derivative: f.derivative(z).\nThe rest part is simpler and more or less linear. We calculate partialDerivative and update layer weights and biases.\nWe pass current layer weight and delta to the next layer. Usage of foldRight helps us easily to pass these parameters to the next layer.\n\nThis folding loop returns updated list of weights, which is, of course, has equal length comapre to the original list.\nData Preparation\nBefore we start learning, we need to prepare initial data for the training. \nUnfortunately, data preparation requires us quite a lot of code to write. \ndef createEncoders[T: Numeric: ClassTag](\n    data: Tensor2D[String]\n  ): Tensor2D[String] =&gt; Tensor2D[T] =\n  val encoder = LabelEncoder[String]().fit(data.col(2))\n  val hotEncoder = OneHotEncoder[String, T]().fit(data.col(1))\n  \n  val label = x =&gt; encoder.transform(x, 2)\n  val hot = x =&gt; hotEncoder.transform(x, 1)\n  val typeTransform = (x: Tensor2D[String]) =&gt; transform[T](x.data)\n  \n  label andThen hot andThen typeTransform\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nval dataLoader = TextLoader(Path.of(\"data\", \"Churn_Modelling.csv\")).load()\nval data = dataLoader.cols[String](3, -1)\n\nval encoders = createEncoders[Float](data)\nval numericData = encoders(data)\nval scaler = StandardScaler[Float]().fit(numericData)\n\nval prepareData = (d: Tensor2D[String]) =&gt; {\n  val numericData = encoders(d)\n  scaler.transform(numericData)\n}\n\nval x = prepareData(data)\nval y = dataLoader.cols[Float](-1)\n\n\nFirst, we load raw data from a CSV file, then we select all columns between 3-rd and last one (-1 means: length - 1).\nInitial data is of String type, later we choose numerical data type such as Float.\nWe compose label, one-hot encoders and data type transformer into a function inside the createEncoders function. That allows us to use prepareData function later for validation dataset.\ny data we take from the last column of the dataset.\n\nI am not going to describe the entire code of data preparation classes. The goal of encoders is to \nprepare data for deep neural network training and inference. We normalise all columns as per their individual means and \nstandard deviations. Also, we encode categorical columns using 0 and 1 using one-hot encoding approach.\nTraining Run\nval ((xTrain, xTest), (yTrain, yTest)) = (x, y).split(0.2f)\nval model = ann.train(xTrain, yTrain, epochs = 100)\n\nWe split x and y data into 80% and 20% parts for training and testing accordingly.\nFinally, we execute the training for 100 epochs.\nsbt:ann&gt; run\n[info] running starter\nepoch:

in sec\n\nWe can see that accuracy is increasing quite quick. Also, loss value is becoming stable already after 20 epochs.\nEntire training for 8000 data samples takes less than 6 seconds.\nTesting\nSingle Test\n// Single test\nval example = TextLoader(\n  \"n/a,n/a,n/a,600,France,Male,40,3,60000,2,1,1,50000,n/a\"\n).cols[String](3, -1)\nval testExample = prepareData(example)\nval exited = \n  predictedToBinary(model.predict(testExample).as1D.data.head) == 1\nprintln(s\"Exited customer? $exited\")\n\nWe use predict method on the model to test prediction on the single data sample:\nExited customer? false\nDataset Test\nWe have left 20% of the initial data for testing purposes. So now we can check trained model accuracy on new data \nthat model had never seen before:\nval testPredicted = model.predict(xTest)\nval value = accuracy(yTest, testPredicted)\nprintln(s\"test accuracy = $value\")  \n\nModel accuracy on unseen data is quite as well:\ntest accuracy = 0.8625\nPython Implementation\nAlmost the same implementation in Python takes much longer to train the model. \nAlthough, we are using a bit more advanced optimizer such as Adam.\nHere is the code snippet that starts model training:\nann.compile(optimizer = 'adam', \\\n  loss = 'binary_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy'])\n\nimport time\nstart = time.process_time()\nann.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size = 32, epochs = 100)\nend = time.process_time() - start\nprint(f\"training time = {end} sec\")\ntraining time = 24.495086\n\nIt is almost 5 times longer. I knew that Python is slow language.\nSee full code here: tensorflow-ann-python\nSummary\nWe have seen that Scala implementation looks very concise thanks to the great language design.\nIt also works faster than Python implementation in Keras on CPU.\nArtificial Neural Network can be understood by newbies as magic, \nbut a closer look shows that basic building blocks are just math.\nBeing a functional programmer in Scala, you may find that some of the code is not doing total functions, but partial functions by throwing erros. \nUnfortunatelly, there are several possibilities where user may provide\nwrong inputs from math perspective, so that we could return an Either.Left or something like that to mitigate this problem.\nMaking a machine learning library is fun, since it is just algorithms and in-memory computations.\nYou do not need to deal with that much I/O, networking or distributed systems programming.\nMain part even does not parallelise, so no concurrency and cognitive overhead related with it. \nOf course, to make an ML library today for real life, you would require support of GPU for faster, parallel computation.\nImplemented code demonstrates two points:\n\nANN is an algorithm that you can implement yourself in any programming language. No magic is involved.\nScala is a perfect language to implement libraries for data science and machine learning.\n\nSource Code\nEntire code of the Scala ANN implementation can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/novakov-alexey/deep-learning-scala\nReference Links\n\n\nArtificial-Neural-Network-ANN-4-Backpropagation\n\n\nbackpropagation---the-heart-of-neural-networks\n\n\nAn overview of gradient descent optimization algorithms\n\n\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ann-in-scala-2/","title":"Artificial Neural Network in Scala - part 2"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ann-mnist/":{"body":"Deep Feed Forward Neural Network is one of the type of Artificial Neural Networks, which is also able to classify computer images.\nIn order to feed pixel data into the neural net in RBG/Greyscale/other format one can map every pixel to network inputs.\nThat means every pixel becomes a feature. It may sound scary and highly inefficient to feed, let's say, 28 hieght on 28 width image size, which is 784 features to learn from.\nHowever, neural networks can learn from the pixel data successfully and classify unseen data. We are going to prove this.\nPlease note, there are additional type of networks which are more efficient in image classification such as Convolutional Neural Network, but we are going to talk about that next time.\nDataset\n\n\nMNIST dataset is a \"Hello, World!\" dataset in the field of Deep Learning. \nIt consists of thousands of grey-scaled images which represent hand-written digits from 0 to 9,\nso 10 labels. This dataset is used by many researches in the field to evaluate their discoveries and test that on well-known dataset. \nHowever, MNIST dataset should not be a panacea. There are other public datasets with images like ImageNet, AlexNet, etc., \nwhich are more advanced as they have more objects than just hand-written digits.\nNevertheless, MNIST made important contribution to the history of Deep Learning and still helps people to learn this field by playing with this dataset.\nLoading Data\nMNIST dataset can be taken from Yann LeCun web-site: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. If it is unavailable, you can easily find\na copy of this dataset in numerous GitHub repositories, since it is not big in size (for example here). I have downloaded the following 4 archives and put into the folder images. \n9.5M train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz\n28K  train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz\n\n1.6M t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz\n4.4K t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz\n\nFirst two files is training dataset. Bigger file is for images and smaller is for labels. There are 60000 training images and labels for them.\nNext two files are for model testing following the same concept (images, labels). There are 10000 testing images and labels.\nIn order to load these files into the  memory we need to follow MNIST file format specification.\nFor each file we need to do:\n\nRead first magic number and compare it with MNIST expected number, which is:\n\nval LabelFileMagicNumber = 2049\nval ImageFileMagicNumber = 2051\n\n\nRead next number for number of rows \nRead next number for number of columns\nRead images and labels in the loop based on the number of rows and columns\n\nWe are going to implement MNIST classification on top of the existing mini-libary for Deep Learning.\nHere is how we can load MNIST dataset:\nimport scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer\nimport scala.reflect.ClassTag\n\nimport java.io.{DataInputStream, BufferedInputStream, FileInputStream}\nimport java.nio.file.{Files, Path}\nimport java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream\n\ndef loadDataset[T: ClassTag](images: Path, labels: Path)(\n    using n: Numeric[T]\n  ): (Tensor[T], Tensor[T]) =\n\n  val imageStream = new GZIPInputStream(Files.newInputStream(images))\n  val imageInputStream = new DataInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(imageStream))\n  val magicNumber = imageInputStream.readInt()\n  \n  assert(magicNumber == ImageFileMagicNumber, \n    s\"Images magic number is incorrect, expected $ImageFileMagicNumber, \n    but was $magicNumber\")\n\n  val numberOfImages = imageInputStream.readInt()\n  val (nRows, nCols) = (imageInputStream.readInt(), imageInputStream.readInt())\n\n  val labelStream = new GZIPInputStream(Files.newInputStream(labels))\n  val labelInputStream = new DataInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(labelStream))  \n  val labelMagicNumber = labelInputStream.readInt()\n\n  assert(labelMagicNumber == LabelFileMagicNumber, \n    s\"Labels magic number is incorrect, expected $LabelFileMagicNumber, \n    but was $labelMagicNumber\")\n\n  val numberOfLabels = labelInputStream.readInt()\n\n  assert(numberOfImages == numberOfLabels)\n  \n  val labelsTensor = labelInputStream.readAllBytes.map(l =&gt; n.fromInt(l)).as1D\n\n  val singeImageSize = nRows * nCols\n  val imageArray = ArrayBuffer.empty[Array[T]]\n\n  for i &lt;- (0 until numberOfImages) do\n    val image = (0 until singeImageSize)\n      .map(_ =&gt; n.fromInt(imageInputStream.readUnsignedByte())).toArray      \n    imageArray += image\n\n  (imageArray.toArray.as2D, labelsTensor)\nPreparing data\nBefore we construct a neural network to train it on MNIST dataset, we need to transform it a bit.\nFeature normalisation\nIn order to be more efficient when learning weights we need to scale X data to be in [0, 1] data range.\nWe know that every image is encoded as a matrix of pixels 28 x 28. If print one of the\nimage data into the console with line breaks after 28-th element, then it will look like this:\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0  84 185 159 151  60  36   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0 222 254 254 254 254 241 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 170  52   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0  67 114  72 114 163 227 254 225 254 254 254 250 229 254 254 140   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  17  66  14  67  67  67  59  21 236 254 106   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  83 253 209  18   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  22 233 255  83   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0 129 254 238  44   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  59 249 254  62   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0 133 254 187   5   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   9 205 248  58   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0 126 254 182   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  75 251 240  57   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  19 221 254 166   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   3 203 254 219  35   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  38 254 254  77   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  31 224 254 115   1   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0 133 254 254  52   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  61 242 254 254  52   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0 121 254 254 219  40   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0 121 254 207  18   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n\nAbove output corresponds to digit \"7\".\nData in 0-255 numeric range will explode our network gradient if we do not apply any optimization technique on\ngradient or weight values. The easiest way is to scale the input data.\nFirst we load data using previously defined function with one more case class as a wrapper:\nval dataset = MnistLoader.loadData[Double](\"images\")\n\nwhere dataset is wrapped into a case class:\ncase class MnistDataset[T: Numeric](\n  trainImage: Tensor[T], \n  trainLabels: Tensor[T], \n  testImages: Tensor[T], \n  testLabels: Tensor[T])\n\nThen we simply divide every value by 255, that gives data in [0,1] range format.\nval xData = dataset.trainImage.map(_ / 255d)  \nTarget Encoding\nOur model is going to predict one label over multi-class dataset. In order to make our neural network \nto predict something we need to encode label tensor with One-Hot encoder, so that every scalar label becomes as\na vector of zeros and a single 1. Index of 1 corresponds to the digit that this label stores.\nMNIST data is currently a vector of numbers, where number is a label for hand-written digit. For example:\n[7,5,0,1]\n\nOnce we one-hot encode it, it will look like:\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]\n[0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWe can reuse OneHotEncoder implemented earlier:\nval encoder = OneHotEncoder(classes = (0 to 9).map(i =&gt; (i.toDouble, i.toDouble)).toMap)\nval yData = encoder.transform(dataset.trainLabels.as1D)\nCommon preparation\nLet's wrap both transformation into one function:\ndef prepareData(x: Tensor[Double], y: Tensor[Double]) =\n  val xData = x.map(_ / 255d) // normalize to [0,1] range\n  val yData = encoder.transform(y.as1D)\n  (xData, yData)\n\nNow we can call it like this:\nval (xTrain, yTrain) = prepareData(dataset.trainImage, dataset.trainLabels)\nModel construction\nOur model is going to be designed/trained with:\n\nnodes: 784 x 100 x 10\nactivation: ReLU, Softmax\nloss: cross-entropy\naccuracy: via argmax\ninitialisation: Kaiming\noptimizer: Adam\n\nval ann = Sequential[Double, Adam, HeNormal](\n  crossEntropy,\n  learningRate = 0.001,\n  metrics = List(accuracy),\n  batchSize = 128,\n  gradientClipping = clipByValue(5.0d)\n)\n  .add(Dense(relu, 100))      \n  .add(Dense(softmax, 10))\n\nAdam optimizer gets better results on MNIST data, so we stick to it, rather than with standard Stochastic Gradient Descent.\nActivations\nWe have already seen ReLU activation function, but let's recall its definition:\ndef relu[T: ClassTag](x: Tensor[T])(using n: Numeric[T]): Tensor[T] =\n  x.map(t =&gt; max(n.zero, t))\n\nImportant note here that it is applied element-wise, i.e. for every element of z matrix in the layer.\nHowever, softmax activation function is applied across nodes of the layer to get the probability which sums up to 1.\nThis activation function is a typical choice for multi-class problem type. When we feed input data sample into the network, \nwe want to get an output as vector with probabilities for each class.\nComing back to MNIST target, below representation shows that most likely the target value is digit \"4\", \nbecause the highest argument is \"0.5\" at index [4].\nscala&gt; List(0.01, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.5, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.01, 0.02).sum\nval res0: Double = 1.0\n\nThis is how we can implement softmax:\nval toleration = castFromTo[Double, T](0.4E-15d)\n\ndef softmax(x: Tensor[T]): Tensor[T] =       \n  val applied = x.mapRow { row =&gt;\n    val max = row.max        \n    val expNorm = row.map(v =&gt; exp(v - max))         \n    val sum = expNorm.sum        \n    expNorm.map(_ / sum)\n  }\n  \n  // rest is an extra defence against numeric overflow\n  val appliedSum = applied.sumCols.map( v =&gt; \n    if v.abs - toleration &gt; n.one \n    then v \n    else n.one\n  )\n  val totalSum = appliedSum.sumRows.as0D.data      \n  assert(totalSum == x.length, \n    s\"Softmax distribution sum is not equal to 1 at some activation, but\\n${appliedSum}\")\n  \n  applied\n\nIt is obviously more complicated than relu. This is what the above code is doing:\n\nFor each row: Array[T] of the x Tensor we find a max value and substract it from each value of this row to get stable values in the vector.\nThe reason to subtract max is to avoid numeric overflow.\nApply exponent to each value right after the max subtraction.\nMake a sum of exponents.\nFinally, use exponent vector to divide each value by the sum.\nAdditionally, we raise an error if a sum of individual values in\nthe vector is not equal to 1. Such situation may happen \ndue to numeric overflow. If it happens, then we may end up with exploding gradient (as a result bad training outcome).\nHowever, we tolerate numeric difference of 0.4E-15d, i.e. it should be no more than 1.0000000000000004.\n\nIn order to perform back-propagation with gradient descent we need softmax derivative as well. \nThis is simplest version of softmax derivative:\ndef derivative(x: Tensor[T]): Tensor[T] =       \n  val sm = softmax(x)      \n  sm.multiply(n.one - sm) // element-wise multiplication, NOT dot product\nLoss function\nCross-entropy can then be used to calculate the difference between the two probability distributions and \ntypical choice for multi-class classification. It can written in code as:\ndef crossEntropy[T: ClassTag: Numeric](y: T, yHat: T): T = \n  y * log(yHat)\n\nIt will return some value as a as difference. Example of input vectors:\nsome random yHat = [0.1, 0.1, 0, 0.8, ...] - it will be length of 10 in our MNIST case\n        actual y = [0, 0, 0, 1, ........ ] - length 10\n\nTo get an idea whey cross-entropy is a usefull loss function to our problem, please have a look at this blog-post.\nAccuracy\nBefore we calculate a number of correct predictions, we need to not just compare y and yHat vectors, \nbut first need to find an index of the max element in the y and yHat vectors.\nSo we need to help the existing algorithm to extract from the yHat vector the value of the label, i.e. predicted digit. \nFunction called argmax can be used for this task:\ndef accuracyMnist[T: ClassTag: Ordering](using n: Numeric[T]) = new Metric[T]:\n  val name = \"accuracy\"\n  \n  def matches(actual: Tensor[T], predicted: Tensor[T]): Int =      \n    val predictedArgMax = predicted.argMax      \n    actual.argMax.equalRows(predictedArgMax)\n\nval accuracy = accuracyMnist[Double]\n\nAccuracy is a Metric type-class that has matches method to return a number of correct predictions.\nThe argMax itself as generic tensor function:\ndef argMax[T: ClassTag](t: Tensor[T])(using n: Numeric[T]) =\n  def maxIndex(a: Array[T]) = \n    n.fromInt(a.indices.maxBy(a))\n\n  t match\n    case Tensor2D(data) =&gt; Tensor1D(data.map(maxIndex))\n    case Tensor1D(data) =&gt; Tensor0D(maxIndex(data))\n    case Tensor0D(_) =&gt; t\nWeight Initialisation\nWeight initialisation approach is important factor in Deep Learning to converge model training faster or even to avoid vanished or exploded gradient.\nKaiming weight initialisation is helping to address above problems. So let's use that as well:\ngiven [T: ClassTag: Numeric]: ParamsInitializer[T, HeNormal] with    \n  val rnd = new Random() \n\n  def gen(lenght: Int): T = \n    castFromTo[Double, T]{\n      val v = rnd.nextGaussian + 0.001d // value shift is optional\n      v * math.sqrt(2d / lenght.toDouble)\n    }\n\n  override def weights(rows: Int, cols: Int): Tensor[T] =\n    Tensor2D(Array.fill(rows)(Array.fill[T](cols)(gen(rows))))\n\n  override def biases(length: Int): Tensor[T] = \n    zeros(length)\n\nWe initialise biases to zeros. Weight matrices are initialised using random generator with normal distribution. Every random number then\nmultiplied by sqrt(2 / n), where n is a number of input nodes for this particular layer.\nModel Training\nNow we are ready to start training process.\nval model = ann.train(xTrain, yTrain, epochs = 15, shuffle = true)\n epoch: 1/15, avg. loss: 0.04434336993179046, metrics: [accuracy: 0.8785666666666667]\n epoch: 2/15, avg. loss: 0.024939809896450383, metrics: [accuracy: 0.9350166666666667]\n epoch: 3/15, avg. loss: 0.02028075875579972, metrics: [accuracy: 0.9478833333333333]\n epoch: 4/15, avg. loss: 0.017196840063260558, metrics: [accuracy: 0.9560833333333333]\n epoch: 5/15, avg. loss: 0.01491209973340988, metrics: [accuracy: 0.9625666666666667]\n epoch: 6/15, avg. loss: 0.01350024657628137, metrics: [accuracy: 0.9671833333333333]\n epoch: 7/15, avg. loss: 0.01222168129663168, metrics: [accuracy: 0.9699]\n epoch: 8/15, avg. loss: 0.011222418180870991, metrics: [accuracy: 0.9729833333333333]\n epoch: 9/15, avg. loss: 0.010388172803460627, metrics: [accuracy: 0.9752833333333333]\n epoch: 10/15, avg. loss: 0.009549474708521941, metrics: [accuracy: 0.97765]\n epoch: 11/15, avg. loss: 0.008920235294999721, metrics: [accuracy: 0.9787]\n epoch: 12/15, avg. loss: 0.008214811390229967, metrics: [accuracy: 0.9806833333333334]\n epoch: 13/15, avg. loss: 0.0077112882811408694, metrics: [accuracy: 0.9824]\n epoch: 14/15, avg. loss: 0.0071559669134910325, metrics: [accuracy: 0.98405]\n epoch: 15/15, avg. loss: 0.006797865863855411, metrics: [accuracy: 0.9848]\n\nWe have gotten quite good accuracy on training. \n98.4% correct predictions, which is 1.6% errors.\n\n\n\n\nModel Testing\nval (xTest, yTest) = prepareData(dataset.testImages, dataset.testLabels)\nval testPredicted = model(xTest)\nval value = accuracy(yTest, testPredicted)\nprintln(s\"test accuracy = $value\")\n\nAccuracy on test data is quite close to the train accuracy:\ntest accuracy = 0.9721\n\nWe can also try to run a single test on the first image from the test dataset:\nval singleTestImage = dataset.testImages.as2D.data.head\nval label = dataset.testLabels.as1D.data.head // this must be \"7\" \nval predicted = model(singleTestImage.as2D).argMax.as0D.data  \n\nassert(label == predicted, \n  s\"Predicted label is not equal to expected '$label' label, but was '$predicted'\")\n\nprintln(s\"predicted = $predicted\")\npredicted = 7.0\nSummary\nWe have seen that even one hidden layer is able to classify MNIST dataset with quite low error rate. \nKey takeaways when classifying images are:\n\nmake sure that gradient is not going to explode or vanish. For that, we can use proper weight initialisation, \nclipping gradient by value or norm any other weight normalisation during the training. Also scale or normalise the input data\nuse one-hot encoding for your target variable in case of multi-class classification\nin case of single label prediction, use argmax function\nuse softmax activation at the last layer to distribute probabilities across classes.\n\nTry Convolutional Neural Network as a next step in image classification problem.\nLinks\n\nSource code of mini-library: deep-learning-scala\nMNIST Handwritten digits classification from scratch using Python Numpy\nsoftmax.py eliben/deep-learning-samples\n\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ann-mnist/","title":"MNIST image recognition using Deep Feed Forward Network"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/aws-saa-exam/":{"body":"Earlier this year I started learning few Udemy courses for AWS Solution Architect Associate Certification. My initial plan was just to get some basic knowledge about AWS services, not the certification itself. Before starting the course, I did not have any experience with native AWS services. I never used EC2 instances to launch something in production. However, I used EC2 fleet of instances to deploy Kubernetes cluster. I started my path to cloud-native tools with Docker and shifted later to Kubernetes and OpenShift. Pure AWS services were never on my radar. I think the experience of deploying Kubernetes on top of the EC2 instances is one thing, but using different AWS services like ELB, EBS, EFS, EC2 and S3 is completely another story. So I decided it is time to get to know what are those AWS main services. After coming to the end of the Udemy course, I realised it worth to go for certification to make a final point in my AWS education. As I already spent so much time. \n\n\n\nEventually I got certification after 7 calendar months. During that time, I did several pauses for vacation and other activities at work, when\nlearning AWS was too hard to keep in my head. Perhaps, pure learning time was from 3 to 4 months.\nPreparation\nThe final path I followed looks likes this:\n\nMain Udemy preparation courses:\n\nAWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - 2020 SAA-C02 from Neal Davis\nUltimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate 2020 from Stephane Maarek\n\n\nAWS Free Video Courses\nAWS related project at work ;-) \nUdemy SAA Practise Exams from Neal Davis\nUdemy AWS VPC and Networking in Depth from Chetan Agrawal\n\nThe best learning was in a project at work. However, theoretical knowledge helped quiet a lot to be fast in practise. \nHow to pass the exam\nEvery Udemy preparation course contains a series of labs almost for every lecture. Let's say a block on AWS VPC (Virtual Public Cloud) has 15 lectures, then there are around 10 labs that you need to practise on your own.\nComposition of the theoretical and practical labs at platform like Udemy plus real experience at work\ngives you a high chance to pass the certification for \"Associate\" level. Recommended practical experience from Amazon to pass \"Associate\" level is 1 year.\nI spent several times less with regards to practical experience. I believe those who already has practical experience of 1 year with AWS can easily\nwatch one of the MOOC course and straight away go for certification exam. If you want to go for certification in relaxed mode, then take your time\nby working on some project at work related to AWS.\nThe hardest thing is to motivate yourself to go for certification after one or more years of working with AWS. I think some people will eventually loose the \nmotivation in certification, since they are already so professional that they might think the certification is just waist of time. \nBy end the day, the certification exam is also a stressful exercise. You either have to go to a certification centre in your city or go for online exam at home or office. So it gives you some headache.\nRecommendations\nTake notes\nAfter watching and practising with topic number 10 out of 25 topics I quickly realised that I should have been taking some summary notes for\nlecture I watched and practised before. So that I could quickly review my notes and recall those topics I learnt earlier. I started making an AWS mind map.\nSince I was using mind maps for almost 10 years already, it was natural choice for me. The mind mapping software I use called XMind. \nSo I started to do mind map in the middle of the first course, then I fulfilled the missing topics while watching second course, so that it covers\nall possible topics related to Solution Architect Associate certification. Eventually, I got around 1600 nodes in my mind map tree. XMind software\nperformance is not good on my old 8 GB RAM laptop. It is probably not good practise to create such big mind maps. I could probably go with a separate mind map\nper AWS topic or separate tab in the same map, but then I would ended up with 20 different maps or tabs. \nA text search across different mind maps would be a nightmare then. If you know a solution for big mind map problem, please let me know.\nBelow picture show some part of the AWS mind map I created as summary notes:\n\n\nMy mind map became so big that I can't really print it easily, if I would want that.\nYou can go with your own way of making notes. The important thing is to do them, rather than trying to keep everything in your head. Some people say\nthat hand-written notes are the best way to remember a lot in your head. I am always struggling with handwritten notes to transfer them into digital format.\nThere are some tools for that, but it is not straightforward. So I abandoned an idea of paper or tablet handwritten notes until some time in future.\nOne thing with regards to mind map, I think a mind map is useful only for the mind map author. If I read someone else's mind map, I can't remember it nor learn something with it. A mind map is a personal tool like personal notes in a notebook. There is only you who can understand your notes, since it reflects your brain work.\nYoutube\nDo not waste time by watching free videos on youtube for AWS certification, since it is not going to be a complete course. They will probably not provide\npractise test after each topic nor test exams with 65 questions each. This is the state of 2020 year. Maybe in future the things get change on Youtube, \nso that we will be able to do full blown MOOCs there as well. We will see.\nExam Topics\nI am software developer by trade. Back in my university I had no any strong focus on computer networking. This topic was the most difficult for me at AWS\ncertification. All those Sys Admin related things like block storage, VPN, firewall (security groups, network ACL), network file systems, encryption, DNS\ntook me several iteration until I finally learnt that. \nBelow is a list of topics which are required from you to learn to pass the certification exam.\n1. VPC\nIt is huge block that includes many things to get familiar with:\n\nIP ranges / CIDRs\nGateway Endpoint\nVPC endpoint\nSecurity group, Network ACL\nSubnet\nNAT Gateway, Instance\nSite-to-Site VPN\nDirect Connect\nTransit Gateway\nRoute table\nVPC flow logs\nPrivate Link\nVPC peering\nVPN CloudHub\nInterface endpoint\n\nThis topic was the most difficult for me. All that I listed above you need to know well before going to Solution Architect certification.\n2. EC2\nIt is also quite large and popular topic on the exam. Requires to know:\n\nPricing Models: Reserved, On-Demand, Dedicated, Scheduled, etc.\nRelation to AMIs (VM images), location of AMIs, etc.\nPlacement groups: cluster, spread, partition\nIP address types: private public, Elastic IP\nHPC features: EFA, Enhanced Networking\nEC2 instance lifecycle\nEC2 API: user, meta data\n\nThis topic was tricky for me as well, after being working for several years with Kubernetes. I did not care what underlying infrastructure was used.\nVMs or bare-metal servers. Anyway, I found EC2 topic as important as VPC. Basically, it is one of the building block of the AWS. You must know\nthis topic very well.\n3. ELB, Route53, CDN\nElastic Load Balancing is popular topic too. \n\nGeneral idea is to know how different load balancers can be used with EC2 instances, Target Groups.\nDifferent target types: EC2, IP, Lambda function\nWhen to use ALB, NLB or CLB\nAuto Scaling group connection with ELB and Target Groups\nRelation to CloudWatch and EC2 metrics\nDifferent features like Global Accelerator, HA setup using Availability Zones, stick sessions. multi-VPC balancing\nWAF\nDNS record sets\nRoute 53 DNS policies (latency, failover, geo-proximity, etc.)\nCloudFront\n\n4. Security\n\nKMS: key types from management perspective, supported encryption algorithms\nS3 data encryption types at rest (quite popular topic)\nEncryption support per data storage and database service: EBS, EFS, RDS, etc.\nHigh-level knowledge on different services for security like Certification Manager, Shield, Artefact\n\n5. Databases &amp; Data Processing\n\nRDS master and replica encryption. There are several lifecycle transitions to remember like how to make encrypted database from unencrypted database.\nAurora, Serverless, Global\nDynamoDB\nKinesis, Firehose\nRedShift\nAthena\nGlue\nEMR\nData Migration Service\nElasticCache: difference between Redis and Memcached\nDataSync\nNeptune\n\nRDS, DynamoDB are the most popular topics on the exam. However, you need to know main capabilities of other databases/tools.\n6. Integration\n\nSQS\nSNS\nAmazon MQ\nStep Functions\nSystem Manager Parameter Store\nSWF\nAppSync\n\nYou need to know the difference between SQS versus SNS very well.\n7. IAM\n\nUsers, Groups, Roles, Policies\nAuthentication types\nOrganization and SCP\nResource Access Manager\n\n8. Storage\nAs I mention, it was quite hard topic for me, since you need to remember the IOPS per each disk type,\nstorage class durability, availability, minimum storage period, retrieval period, prices\nThere are many sub-options to keep in mind. It is quite large topic and as popular on the exam as VPC and EC2.\n\nEBS\nEFS\nS3\nInstance Store\nStorage Gateway\nFSx for Windows, Lustre\n\n9. Dev Tools\n\nLambda\nAPI Gateway\nSAM\nECS, ECR, Fargate, EKS\nCodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline (just know what they are offering)\n\n10. Operations\n\nOpsWorks\nCloud Formation\nServer Migration Service\nRecovery strategies: Backup and Restore, Pilot light, Warm Standby, Multi Site\n\n11. Monitoring, Auditing\n\nCloudWatch Logs, Alarms, Events\nCloudTrail\nTrustedAdvisor\nAWS Config \n\nThose service that I have not commented above you just need high-level understanding what they do and that is enough.\nWhen and How to go for Exam\nOnce you feel it is time to get a certification exam, make sure you have passed through any test / simulation exam at Udemy, anywhere you can find them.\nCheck sample questions at AWS training web-site. \nIn my case, it was very helpful to study right answers for failed questions at Udemy test exams.\nBasically, these simulation tests already show you a percentage result whether you can pass real exam and how close you are to 72% of right answers.\nI think if you above 80% right answers you can go for exam.\nThese days everything is happening remotely as well as certification at AWS. You can schedule an exam by make an order at \"aws.training / certmetrics\" web-sites.\nChose exam provider and day for an exam. \nIn my case, I could schedule an exam on next day I checked the available time slots, so there is\nno long time waiting to schedule an exam.\nIf you feel that you are already overloaded with the theory while preparing for an exam, then it is a sign that you are ready to for the certification.\nOf course, need to try all possible test exams and see if you get good percentage of right answers. Some people do not pass from the first time, but\nmost of the time pass from the second attempt. So do not bother if you did not pass first time, it is going to be a good rehearsal since you will be able\nto see real questions and get familiar with level of complexity. As for me, it was very important to know how difficult those real exam questions.\nOnce I started the exam I realised that I can cope with the real questions. \nOne last recommendation, do not stay too long on one question during the real exam. I would say 1.5 minute per question\nshould be enough. Some questions can be answered within 10 seconds. It highly depends on the question length. Udemy test exams have lengthy question and that is quite close to reality.\nSummary\nAlthough it requires quite a lot of time and efforts to go for any certification, it worth to do just because you will really learn a lot.\nI would not learn that amount of knowledge in case I would just watch the video course. Also, certification may help you\nto win a good project if you are working in a company or for yourself as a contractor. \n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/aws-saa-exam/","title":"Path to AWS Solution Architect Certification"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/cnn-in-scala/":{"body":"Last time we used ANN to train a Deep Learning model for image recognition using MNIST dataset.\nThis time we are going to look at more advanced network called Convolutional Neural Network or CNN in short.\nCNN is designed to tackle image recognition problem. However, it can be used not only for image recognition. \nAs we have seen last time, ANN using just hidden layers can learn quite well on MNIST.\nHowever, for real life use cases we need higher accuracy. The main idea of CNN is to learn how to recognise object in their different shapes and positions \nusing specific features of the image data. The goal of CNN is better model regularisation by using convolution and pooling operations.\n\nCNN adds two more type of layers:\n\nConvolution layer\nMax, Average or Global Pooling layer\n\nConvolution is a mathematical operation, which is used in CNN layers instead of matrix multiplication like in fully-connected (dense) layers.\nTypical CNN may consist of several Convolutional and Pooling layers. Final part of the network consists of the fully-connected layers like in ANN.\nBelow picture is showing typical CNN architecture with Tensor shapes. For example, 32x32x1 is an input image 32 pixels width and height having 1 color channel:\n\n\nI will clarify what other shapes dimensions mean further.\nCNN Topology\nWe are going to design a simple CNN architecture for image recognition of the MNIST dataset. The problem type will be still the same:\npredict a hand-written digit based on input image data. CNN works with image properties like height, width and color depth (RGB, etc.). \nBasically, it uses image pixel matrices to perform convolution and pooling operations. \nCNN works with every color channel separately. After some point, channels add up to each other using element-wise addition.\nI am going to build CNN using my existing mini-library in Scala:\nval cnn = Sequential[Precision, Adam, HeNormal](\n    crossEntropy,\n    learningRate = 0.001,\n    metrics = List(accuracy),\n    batchSize = 128,\n    gradientClipping = clipByNorm(5.0),\n    printStepTps = true\n  )    \n    .add(Conv2D(relu, 8, kernel = (5, 5), strides = (1, 1)))    \n    .add(MaxPool(strides = (1, 1), pool = (2, 2), padding = false))       \n    .add(Flatten2D())\n    .add(Dense(relu, 50))      \n    .add(Dense(softmax, 10))\n\nThere are 3 more layers that we have not seen before. \nConvolution Layer\nConv2D is a Scala case class which has already familiar to us relu parameter as an activation function. Other unique parameters of convolution layer:\n\nfilterCount = 8 - number of filters which are going to be trained/optimised via gradient descent and back-propagation\nkernel  = (5, 5) - window height and width to apply on input image/matrix\nstrides = (1, 1) - increment value when moving filter over the input image/matrix to the right (1 and to the bottom 1)\n\nWhile implementing CNN we are going to enter the world of 4-dimensional tensors. Conv2D layer will keep its data in 4D Tensor where:\n\n1st dimension is filter count\n2nd - color depth. Grey scale image is 1, RGB is 3, RGBA is 4 and so on.\n3rd - filter height\n4th - filter width\n\nAccording to above code snippet, added filter will have the following trainable weights and biases:\n\nweights shape: (8 x 1 x 5 x 5) Tensor4D\nbiases shape: (8) Tensor1D\n\nExample\nIf we take simple example as image matrix 3 x 4 and filter with weights set from 1 to 4 then we get the following output as z:\n\n\nz value at (0, 0) position is elementwise multiplication and then sum of the elements of the matrix such as\n1 * 1 + 2 * 2 + 3 * 2 + 3 * 4 = 23. Other output elements of the z matrix are produced in the same way.\nEvery layer that we add to Sequential model has at least two methods apply, \nwhich is used to do forward propagation and backward for producing gradients based on the layer input data.\nWe can code forward propagation like this:\n\n// create input image regions with their positions to be used by other functions\nprivate def imageRegions(image: Tensor2D[T], kernel: (Int, Int), stride: (Int, Int)) =\n  val (rows, cols) = image.shape2D    \n  for i &lt;- 0 to rows - kernel._1 by stride._1 yield   \n  for j &lt;- 0 to cols - kernel._2 by stride._2 yield       \n    (image.slice((i, i + kernel._1), (j, j + kernel._2)).as2D, i, j)\n\n// convolution operation which is\n// element-wise multiplication between each image region and filter matrix\nprivate def conv(filterChannel: Tensor2D[T], imageChannel: Tensor2D[T], \n         kernel: (Int, Int), stride: (Int, Int)) =    \n  val filtered = \n    for row &lt;- imageRegions(imageChannel, kernel, stride) yield\n      for (region, _, _) &lt;- row yield\n        (region |*| filterChannel).sum\n\n  filtered.as2D\n\n// main forward function which is used by Conv2D layer to \n// apply every filter channel matrix to every input image.\n// N.B. convoluted channels adds us together\nprivate def forward(kernel: (Int, Int), stride: (Int, Int), \n  x: Tensor[T], w: Tensor[T], b: Tensor[T]): Tensor[T] =\n  val (images, filters) = (x.as4D, w.as4D)    \n   \n  def filterImage(image: Array[Array[Array[T]]]) =\n    filters.data.zip(b.as1D.data).map { (f, b) =&gt;\n      val filtered = f.zip(image).map { (fc, ic) =&gt;\n         conv(fc.as2D, ic.as2D, kernel, stride)\n      }.reduce(_ + _)\n      filtered + b.asT\n    }\n   \n  images.data.par.map(filterImage).toArray.as4D\n\n // Layer interface to the training loop. \n // `w` and `b` are the Layer state.\n override def apply(x: Tensor[T]): Activation[T] =\n   val z = (w, b) match\n     case (Some(w), Some(b)) =&gt; forward(kernel, strides, x, w, b)\n     case _ =&gt; x // does nothing when one of the params is empty    \n   val a = f(z)    \n   Activation(x, z, a)\n\nI have left private modifier to show you that apply function uses other functions internally.\nIn general, forward propagation of the Convolution layer is not that simple as for Dense layer. \nConvolution layer is also computationally intensive in forward and backward propagation.\nThe main line of code in forward propagation is (region |*| filterChannel).sum. It corresponds to element-wise multiplication of two matrices and summing the resulting matrix up\nto get single number as one of the value for the output matrix. \nTensor shape of the forward propagation can be calculated in advance using the following formula:\nval rows = (height - kernel._1) / strides._1 + 1\nval cols = (width - kernel._2) / strides._2 + 1\n// final output shape after layer activation is\nval shape = List(images, filterCount, rows, cols)\n\nimages is a number of images passed via apply, i.e. during the forward propagation. That means we can process a batch of images at once, i.e. at a step. \nWe use similar idea in Dense layers via 2D Tensor to pass multiple images as rows at once (see further).\nPooling Layer\nTypical pooling layer that is used for CNN is Max Pooling. As denoted by its name, it pools maximum elements from some image region to place it into the output matrix.\n\n\nAlthough above example is quite simple, it shows the idea how forward propagation of MaxPool layer works. Basically, it downsamples input image resolution and takes the most\nbright pixels.\nHere is how we can code max pooling forward propagation:\n// shape2D is output shape of this layer\n// this function creates image regions from the input X\nprivate def imageRegions(image: Tensor2D[T], window: (Int, Int), strides: (Int, Int)) =\n  val (rows, cols) = shape2D\n  for i &lt;- 0 until rows by strides._1 yield   \n    for j &lt;- 0 until cols by strides._2 yield          \n      (image.slice((i, i + window._1), (j, j + window._2)).as2D, i, j)\n\n// main function to find max element in the region\nprivate def poolMax(image: Tensor2D[T]): Tensor2D[T] =\n  val (rows, cols) = shape2D\n  val out = Array.ofDim(rows, cols)\n  val pooled = \n    for (region, i, j) &lt;- imageRegions(image, window, strides).flatten yield            \n      out(i)(j) = region.max\n  out.as2D\n\n// Layer interface to forward propagation\ndef apply(x: Tensor[T]): Activation[T] =    \n  val pooled = x.as4D.data.map(_.map(c =&gt; poolMax(c.as2D))).as4D\n  Activation(x, pooled, pooled)\nFlatten2D\nBefore we feed intermediate data from the Convolution and Pooling layers forward, we need to flatten every image to a vector. Image channels are going to be \nappended to each other to get a single vector per image.\nOur Tensor4D becomes a Tensor2D, where every row is an image. It is going to be still a long row per image, but since we have done some convolutions on the input\nimage, such processed data helps a model to learn better and avoid overfitting. \nAgain, real-life CNN network will have multiple convolution and pooling layers, which are not necessarily\ndecrease amount of features, but transform them to achieve better model regularisation.\nThis layer forward propagation is going to be very simple to implement:\ndef apply(x: Tensor[T]): Activation[T] =\n  val flat = x.as2D\n  Activation(x, flat, flat)\n\nWhere .as2D is combining all nested arrays of 4D Tensor starting from axis = 1.\nWhen we flatten input data we get 4232 long vector image. To summarise the Tensor shapes we get the following output shapes:\n\nConv2D shape: 128 x 8 x 24 x 24\nMaxPool shape: 128 x 8 x 23 x 23\nFlatten: 128 x 4232\nDense shape: 128 x 32\nDense shape: 128 x 1\n\nSummary\nIf I run training for 5 epochs it takes a lot time than before with ANN. \nval model = cnn.train(xTrain, yTrain, epochs = 5, shuffle = true)\n\nFirst of all we have more feature now with CNN = 4232 to learn in fully-connected layers.\nBut the main slowness comes from the forward and backward computation of the convolutional and pooling layers. They are much slower than simple dense layer matrix multiplication.\nThis takes up to 1 hour to train on MNIST on 50k images. The highest accuracy score I got was 92%, which is much lower than with ANN = 98.5%. \nAs we have too few layers and most probably exploding/vanishing gradient I could not better result with CNN. However, it is quite possible to get\nthat with production libraries like Tensorflow, where you will get 98% accuracy or higher using the same architecture that I used in this article.\nIf you are curious to know how back-propagation is done for Flatten, MaxPool and Conv layers feel free to look at the code of backward methods here.\nLinks\n\nLibrary source code\nCNN Figure\n\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/cnn-in-scala/","title":"Convolutional Neural Network in Scala"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/cv/":{"body":"Alexey Novakov\nSoftware Solution Architect, Senior Software Engineer,\nRhein-Main Scala Enthusiasts Meetup speaker\nBirthday: 15th of June 1986\nContact: novakov.alex at gmail dot com, cell: +49 152 38993217\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\nCode: https://github.com/novakov-alexey,\nhttps://bitbucket.org/novakov_alex/\nBlog-posts: \n\nCurrent: https://novakov-alexey.github.io\nBefore at Medium: https://medium.com/se-notes-by-alexey-novakov\n\nEducation: Specialist in Computer Science 2003-2008, Donetsk State University of Informatics and Artificial intelligence, Ukraine\nSummary: 16 years of hands-on experience in the field of Software Development, Architecture, System integration,\nFP &amp; OO programming, Designing and Prototyping, Database designing and Specification creating.\nDevelopment practice:\n\nKanban, Scrum, Waterfall, RUP\nCI/CD, Unit testing, TDD, Test automation\nPair Programming\n\nTechnical expertise:\n\nDeveloping commercial applications on Kubernetes, Hadoop, JVM, Oracle, Linux, Docker and Cloud platforms\nDeveloping specifications and design solution documents for long term projects\nDeep and rich expertise on the languages: Java, Scala, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, PHP\n\n\nWork Experience\nSolution Architect in EPAM, Germany\nFeb 2021 – present\n\n    \n        Company\n        \n        EPAM Systems is a provider of software product development and digital platform engineering services.

There are many studies and datasets related to\nhuman faces and their detection/recognition. In this article we will implement Machine Learning pipeline for face detection and recognition using few libraries and CNN model.\nPipeline\nOne the part will be implemented with very popular C++ library OpenCV, which is around for a long time. \nIt has many modules for image processing, object classification, neural networks and more. We are going to use its Java Wrapper - JavaCV\nOpenCV comes with human face detector module, which is called \"Haar Cascade\" classifier. \nThis class takes an image and returns a Rect object of the detected face(s) in it. The Rect object is a data structure that has X and Y coordiantes of\nthe left-top corners plus width and height where region of interest is located. In our case, rectangular area is a face. For example:\nOriginal photo:\n\n\nCropped with Haar Cascade:\n\n\nOnce we get an area of the detected face(s), we can compare its pixel data with in advance extracted face features of known faces. \nComparison algroithm calculates a Euclidean distance between detected face vector with vectors of known faces. \nThe smallest distance with some known face sets its label as a result. \nThat means, we can take known face label that has smallest distance as a result of face identification. \nOur workflow will look like this:\n\n\nPhoto Preparation\nIn order to extract person features, we will prepare separate folder with image per each person:\n\nAlexey (myself)\nGuy Ritchie\nTom Araya\n\nInput directory:\nraw_photos\n├── guy_ritchie\n└── tom_arraya\n\nOutput folder:\ndataset-people\n├── guy_ritchie\n└── tom_arraya\n\n\n\n\nPlus I am adding my photos to dataset-people directory\ndataset-people\n├── alexey\n├── guy_ritchie\n└── tom_arraya\n\nBelow program reads photos from the local folder and crops faces to save them to a separate folder:\n//cropFaces.scala\n\nimport org.bytedeco.opencv.opencv_core.{Rect, Mat, Size}\nimport org.bytedeco.opencv.global.opencv_imgproc.resize\nimport org.bytedeco.opencv.global.opencv_imgcodecs.{imread, imwrite}\n\nimport java.nio.file.{Files, Paths}\n\ndef createIfNotExists(path: String) =\n  if !Files.exists(Paths.get(path)) then \n    Files.createDirectory(Paths.get(path))\n\n@main\ndef crop() =\n  val datasetDir = \"dataset-people\"\n  createIfNotExists(datasetDir)\n\n  val dirs = Paths.get(\"raw_photos\").toFile.listFiles.filter(f =&gt; !f.getName.startsWith(\".\"))\n\n  for dir &lt;- dirs do\n    val label = dir.getName\n    println(s\"Extracting faces for '$label' label\")\n\n    createIfNotExists(Paths.get(datasetDir, label).toString)\n    val images = dir.listFiles.filter(_.toString.endsWith(\".jpg\"))\n\n    for file &lt;- images do\n      println(s\"Reading file: $file\")\n      val image = imread(file.toString)\n      val faces = detectFaces(image)  \n\n      for (face, i) &lt;- faces.get.zipWithIndex do        \n        val crop = Rect(face.x, face.y, face.width, face.height)\n        val cropped = Mat(image, crop)\n        resize(cropped, cropped, Size(ImageHeight, ImageWidth))  \n        val filename = Paths.get(datasetDir, label, s\"$i-${file.getName}\").toString\n        println(s\"Writing $filename\")\n        imwrite(filename, cropped)\n\nThe same code on GitHub is here.\nGet ONNX model\nNow we can extract face features for all three persons. We are going to use CNN model which was trained on the VGGFace dataset.\nThe easiest option to access Keras (which is Python high-level API to Tensorflow) trained model from Scala is to export it to ONNX format. \nLet's proceed:\n\nCreate SavedModel file:\n\n\nInstaniate Python VGGFace class from keras-vggface library\nwith include_top=False to skip last layer of the CNN. \nSave instaniated model to Tensforflow Tensorflow SavedModel\n\nfrom keras_vggface.vggface import VGGFace\n\nIMAGE_HEIGHT = 224\nIMAGE_WIDTH = 224\nCOLOR_CHANNELS = 3\n\noutput_path = 'vggface_model'\nmodel = VGGFace(model='vgg16',\n                include_top=False,\n                input_shape=(IMAGE_HEIGHT, IMAGE_WIDTH, COLOR_CHANNELS),\n                pooling='avg')\nmodel.save(output_path)\n\nImportant: we save VGGFace model without last layer. We do not need any predictions that VGGFace model originally was supposed to output, \nsince we are going to use extracted features to predict other persons than those in original VGGFace dataset.\n\nConvert saved model to ONNX format via tensorflow-onnx library\n\npython -m tf2onnx.convert \\\n  --saved-model vggface_model \\\n  --output data/model.onnx \\\n  --tag serve\n\nAfter converting SavedModel to ONNX we get file data/model.onnx of approx. 56Mb in size:\nExtracting Features\nNow we can use ONNX model from Scala code. In this step, we use VGGFace model to extract features of all 3 person faces\nand save them into a file as HasMap for further step.\nFirst we implement common functions, which we will use one more time for real-time face identification algorithm:\n// common.scala\nimport io.kjaer.compiletime.*\n\nimport org.bytedeco.javacpp.indexer.{UByteIndexer, FloatRawIndexer}\nimport org.bytedeco.opencv.global.opencv_core.*\nimport org.bytedeco.opencv.opencv_core.{Mat, Scalar, RectVector, UMat}\nimport org.bytedeco.opencv.global.opencv_imgproc.*\nimport org.bytedeco.opencv.opencv_objdetect.CascadeClassifier\n\nimport org.emergentorder.compiletime.*\nimport org.emergentorder.onnx.Tensors.*\nimport org.emergentorder.onnx.backends.*\n\nimport java.nio.file.{Files, Paths, Path}\nimport io.bullet.borer.Cbor\nimport java.io.{ByteArrayOutputStream, File}\n\nval OutputSize: Dimension = 512\nval FeatureFilePath = \"data/precomputed_features.cbor\"\n\ntype Features = Map[String, Array[Float]]\n\ndef saveFeatures(features: Features) =\n val file = File(FeatureFilePath)\n Cbor.encode(features).to(file).result\n\ndef getModel(path: Path = Paths.get(\"data\", \"model.onnx\")) =\n val bytes = Files.readAllBytes(path)\n ORTModelBackend(bytes)\n\ndef predict(\n images: Array[Float], \n model: ORTModelBackend, \n batch: Dimension = 1, \n outputSize: Dimension = OutputSize\n) =\n val input = Tensor(images, tensorDenotation, tensorShapeDenotation, shape(batch))\n model.fullModel[\n   Float, \n   \"ImageClassification\", \n   \"Batch\" ##: \"Features\" ##: TSNil, \n   batch.type #: outputSize.type #: SNil](\n     Tuple(input)\n   )\n\ndef scale(img: Mat): Mat =\n val out = Mat()\n img.assignTo(out, CV_32FC4)\n subtract(out, Scalar(93.5940f, 104.7624f, 129.1863f, 0f)).asMat\n\ndef toArray(mat: Mat): Array[Float] =\n val w = mat.cols\n val h = mat.rows\n val c = mat.channels\n val rowStride = w * c\n\n val result = new Array[Float](rowStride * h)\n val indexer = mat.createIndexer[FloatRawIndexer]()\n var off = 0\n var y = 0\n while (y &lt; h)\n   indexer.get(y, result, off, rowStride)\n   off += rowStride\n   y += 1\n\n result\n\nAt this point we can run extraction step:\n//extract.scala\nimport io.kjaer.compiletime.*\nimport org.emergentorder.compiletime.*\nimport org.emergentorder.onnx.Tensors.*\nimport org.emergentorder.onnx.backends.*\nimport org.bytedeco.opencv.global.opencv_imgcodecs.*\nimport org.bytedeco.opencv.opencv_core.{Mat, Scalar}\n\nimport java.nio.file.{Files, Paths}\nimport java.io.File\nimport javax.imageio.ImageIO\nimport scala.collection.parallel.CollectionConverters.*\n\ndef label2Features(dirs: Array[File]) = \n  lazy val model = getModel()\n  val batchSize = 16\n\n  dirs.par.map { dir =&gt;\n    val label = dir.getName\n    println(s\"Extracting features for '$label' at $dir folder\")\n\n    val groups = dir.listFiles.grouped(batchSize)\n    val features = groups.map { files =&gt;\n      val images = files.map(f =&gt; toArray(scale(imread(f.toString)))).flatten\n      val currentBatch = files.length.asInstanceOf[Dimension]      \n      val out = predict(images, model, currentBatch)      \n      out.data.grouped(OutputSize).toList\n    }  \n    label -&gt; features.toList.flatten\n  }\n\n@main\ndef extract =\n  val dirs = Paths.get(\"dataset-people\").toFile.listFiles\n\n  val avgFeatures = label2Features(dirs).map {\n    (label, features) =&gt; \n      val count = features.length      \n      val sum = features.reduce((a, b) =&gt; a.zip(b).map(_ + _))\n      label -&gt; sum.map(_ / count)\n  }.toList.toMap\n\n  saveFeatures(avgFeatures)\n\nIn the extract function, we do element-wise addition of all extracted vectors per each person. \nThen, final person vector is divided by number of images for that person to get average values of the extracted features. \nIn the result we will get/define such type alias:\ntype Features = Map[String, Array[Float]]\nIdentify Faces\nFinally, we can use our extracted features to identify a person face.

Any other person may be confused with one of the three known faces or they can be unknown.\nIf we want to more different people to be identifieable, we need their features as well, so go to step number one of our \npipeline to collect those people photos and extract their features.\n// main.scala\nimport org.bytedeco.opencv.opencv_core.{Mat, Size, Rect, Point, Scalar}\nimport org.bytedeco.opencv.global.opencv_imgproc.*\nimport org.bytedeco.opencv.opencv_videoio.VideoCapture\nimport org.bytedeco.javacv.{CanvasFrame, OpenCVFrameConverter}\n\nimport javax.swing.WindowConstants\n\ndef createCavasFrame = \n val frame = CanvasFrame(\"Detected Faces\")\n frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE)\n frame.setCanvasSize(1280, 720)\n frame\n\ndef calcLabel(face: Array[Float], features: Features, threshold: Int = 100) = \n features.foldLeft(\"?\", Float.MaxValue){ \n   case ((label, min), (l, f)) =&gt; \n     val d = distance(face, f)\n     if d &lt; threshold &amp;&amp; d &lt; min then (l, d)\n     else (label, min)\n }._1  \n\ndef drawLabel(label: String, frame: Mat, topLeft: Point) =\n val x = math.max(topLeft.x - 10, 0)\n val y = math.max(topLeft.y - 10, 0)\n val font = FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX\n val thickness = 2\n val fontScale = 1.0\n val baseline = new Array[Int](2)\n val size = getTextSize(label, font, fontScale, thickness, baseline)\n val rectColor = Scalar(255, 0, 0, 0)\n rectangle(\n   frame,\n   Point(x, y - size.height() - thickness),\n   Point(x + size.width() - thickness, y + 10),\n   rectColor,\n   CV_FILLED,\n   LINE_8,\n   0)\n val fontColor = Scalar(0, 255, 0, 0)\n putText(frame, label, Point(x, y), font, fontScale, fontColor, thickness, CV_FILLED, false)\n\ndef toModelInput(crop: Rect, frame: Mat) =\n val cropped = Mat(frame, crop)\n resize(cropped, cropped, Size(ImageHeight, ImageWidth))\n toArray(scale(cropped))\n\ndef drawRectangle(face: Rect, frame: Mat) =\n rectangle(frame,\n   Point(face.x, face.y),\n   Point(face.x + face.width, face.y + face.height),\n   Scalar(0, 255, 0, 1)\n )\n\nIn the main function we run infinite loop that captures video frame as an image.\nThe captured image is then used to detect and identify person faces.\n@main\ndef demo() =\n val capture = VideoCapture(0)\n val canvasFrame = createCavasFrame  \n val frame = Mat()\n val converter = OpenCVFrameConverter.ToMat()\n val model = getModel()\n val features = loadFeatures\n\n try\n   while capture.read(frame) do\n     val faces = detectFaces(frame)\n     \n     for face &lt;- faces.get yield\n       drawRectangle(face, frame)\n       val crop = Rect(face.x, face.y, face.width, face.height)\n       val image = toModelInput(crop, frame)\n       val faceFeatures = predict(image, model).data\n       val label = calcLabel(faceFeatures, features)\n       drawLabel(label, frame, crop.tl)\n\n     canvasFrame.showImage(converter.convert(frame))                              \n finally\n   capture.release\n   canvasFrame.dispose\nDemo time\n\n\n\n\nIf I put more faces into the frame, identification algorithm may confuse some of them and identify someone with a beard as Tom Araya or someone\nwith bright white skin color as Guy Ritchie.

There are several libraries were used to \nget the face detection working, such as OpenCV. ONNX-Scala to access ONNX model fromm Scala. \nBorer library to save and load face features as Scala object (HashMap) into memory from disk.\nCurrent approach to identify faces by calculating Euclidian distance between input faces and pre-calculated face is not the only one.\nWe could also train custom CNN or VGGFace-based model with new layer to predict labels for Tom, Guy and myself. \nHowever, such approach is compute intensive and actually gave me quite bad results. \nIf you know something crucial about this approach to work well, please let me know.\nOther approaches to solve face identification task which you may want to get familiar with are\nTriplet Loss function and Siamese Networks. \nPerhaps, I will try one of them next time.\nLinks\nYou can find complete project code at GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/novakov-alexey/face-identification/tree/main/src/main/scala\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/face-identification/","title":"Face Identification with VGGFace and OpenCV"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/linear-regression/":{"body":"In this article we are going to use Scala mini-library for Deep Learning\nthat we developed earlier in order to study basic linear regression task. \nWe will learn model weights using perceptron model, which will be our single unit network layer that emits target value. \nThis model will predict a target value yHat based on two trained parameters: weight and bias. Both are scalar numbers.\nWeights optimization is going to be based on implemented Gradient descent algorithm:\n\nGradient Descent Optimization\nTraining Loop\n\nModel equation:\ny = bias + weight * x\nData Preparation\nOur goal is to show that perceptron model can learn the parameters, so that we can generate fake data using\nuniformly distributed random generator:\nimport scala.util.Random\n\nval random = new Random()\nval weight = random.nextFloat()\nval bias = random.nextFloat()\n\ndef batch(batchSize: Int): (ArrayBuffer[Double], ArrayBuffer[Double]) =\n  val inputs = ArrayBuffer.empty[Double]\n  val outputs = ArrayBuffer.empty[Double]\n  def noise = random.nextDouble / 5\n  (0 until batchSize).foldLeft(inputs, outputs) { case ((x, y), _) =&gt;        \n      val rnd = random.nextDouble\n      x += rnd + noise\n      y += bias + weight * rnd + noise\n      (x, y)\n  }\n\nval (xBatch, yBatch) = batch(10000)\nval x = Tensor1D(xBatch.toArray)\nval y = Tensor1D(yBatch.toArray)\nval ((xTrain, xTest), (yTrain, yTest)) = (x, y).split(0.2f)\n\nWe have just prepared two datasets: 8000 data samples for train and 2000 samples for test cycles.\nModel Training\nFirst, we initialise sequential model for just one dense layer with single unit which is going to be a perceptron model.\nval ann = Sequential[Double, SimpleGD](\n  meanSquareError,\n  learningRate = 0.00005f,    \n  batchSize = 16,\n  gradientClipping = clipByValue(5.0d)\n).add(Dense())\n\nIn order to avoid exploding gradient values, we also set grading clipping value, so that whenever our gradient is not\nin -5;5 numeric range it will be clipped to left or right boundary accordingly.\nLet's start training and see if real weight and bias which we used to generate fake data are learnt by the \nperceptron:\nval model = ann.train(xTrain.T, yTrain.T, epochs = 200)\n\nprintln(s\"current weight: ${model.weights}\")\nprintln(s\"true weight: $weight\")\nprintln(s\"true bias: $bias\")\n\nOutput:\nepoch: 1/200, avg. loss: 1.205505132675171\nepoch: 2/200, avg. loss: 1.0070222616195679\nepoch: 3/200, avg. loss: 0.737899661064148\nepoch: 4/200, avg. loss: 0.46094685792922974\nepoch: 5/200, avg. loss: 0.2417953610420227\nepoch: 6/200, avg. loss: 0.10201635956764221\nepoch: 7/200, avg. loss: 0.037492286413908005\nepoch: 8/200, avg. loss: 0.014684454537928104\nepoch: 9/200, avg. loss: 0.00778685137629509\nepoch: 10/200, avg. loss: 0.005894653964787722\n....\nepoch: 190/200, avg. loss: 0.005119443871080875\nepoch: 191/200, avg. loss: 0.005119443871080875\nepoch: 192/200, avg. loss: 0.005119443871080875\nepoch: 193/200, avg. loss: 0.005119443405419588\nepoch: 194/200, avg. loss: 0.005119443405419588\nepoch: 195/200, avg. loss: 0.005119443405419588\nepoch: 196/200, avg. loss: 0.005119443405419588\nepoch: 197/200, avg. loss: 0.005119443405419588\nepoch: 198/200, avg. loss: 0.005119443405419588\nepoch: 199/200, avg. loss: 0.005119443405419588\nepoch: 200/200, avg. loss: 0.005119443405419588\n\nI have cut the middle part of the output, but it is not hard to see the progress.\nLatest model weights:\nweight = sizes: 1x1, Tensor2D[Double]:\n[[0.690990393772042]]\n,\nbias = sizes: 1, Tensor1D[Double]:\n[0.7804058255259821]\n\nOriginal/true weights we used for data generation:\ntrue weight: 0.7220096\ntrue bias: 0.7346627\n\nNumers are quite close to true numbers, but not exactly the same. \nI have set small/slow learningRate as 0.00005f by intention, so that our learning metrics\nwill be smoother on the future plots.

It is written in Scala and can compile, build artefacts for Scala and Java projects. SBT is also the first build\ntool in the Scala eco-system and the most used one among Scala developers. I am using SBT already for many years and found the following useful plugins which I use in most of my projects:\nGiter8\nIt allows to create an SBT project template to ramp up new SBT project. Project template usually includes typical configuration that \nan SBT user copies and pastes from a project to project. User can put any file into a template.\nOne part of the Giter8 is embedded into SBT. The second part is the Giter8 plugin itself. User can create new SBT project from template hosted at GitHub and that the most useful part. You just need an internet access, then run SBT new command. For example:\nsbt new novakov-alexey/scalaboot.g8     \n\nscalaboot.g8 is a name of the GitHub repository at my personal account novakov-alexey. SBT converts template name into\nhttps://github.com/novakov-alexey/scalaboot.g8 path, which you can visit in browser as well. There is also an option to use Giter8 template from the local file system.\nOnce we run above command, Giter8 creates new project file structure such as:\n├── build.sbt\n├── project\n│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── Dependencies.scala\n│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── build.properties\n│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── plugins.sbt\n├── src\n│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── main\n│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── test\n└── version.sbt\nTemplate File Structure\nProject template is also an SBT project :-). In case of scalaboot.g8 example, it looks like this:\n\n\nContent of the g8 folder is a template content which will be used when users apply this template\nfor their projects. Giter8 template supports properties and special syntax for them. Properties can\nbe put at any place of your template. Let's look at the example in build.sbt file:\nThisBuild / organization := \"com.example\"\nThisBuild / scalaVersion := \"$scalaVersion$\"\nThisBuild / description  := \"$desc$\"\n\nlazy val root = (project in file(\".\")).\n  settings(\n    name := \"$name;format=\"lower,hyphen\"$\",\n    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(\n      akkaHttp,\n      akkaStreams,\n      scalaLogging,\n      logback,\n      …\n\n\nA text between $ ... $ is evaluated by Giter8 and replaced by pre-defined or user-given parameters.\nIn my scalaboot template, I have following pre-defined values:\nsrc/main/g8/default.properties\nname=Project Name\ndesc=Describe your project a bit\nscalaVersion=2.13.1\n\nSBT new command is going through the list of defined properties and sets the default values in case\nusers do not provide their own values. In the example below, I apply scalaboot template for\nproject name app-1. I also set my project description and newer Scala version. They will appear in the build.sbt:\n[info] Loading settings for project global-plugins from idea.sbt,gpg.sbt ...\n[info] Loading global plugins from /Users/alexey/.sbt/1.0/plugins\n[info] Set current project to git (in build file:/Users/alexey/dev/git/)\nname [Project Name]: app-1\ndesc [Describe your project a bit]: order registration\nscalaVersion [2.13.1]: 2.13.2\n\nTemplate applied in /Users/alexey/dev/git/./app-1\nSBT Revolver\nIt is simple plugin to be added in a Scala project. However, Giter8 is not necessarily to be added in your project, only when you\ndevelop new template and want to keep it in the GitHub repo. Revolver plugin can be added to project as any other user plugin via project/plugins.sbt file.\nAdding its definition to that file:\naddSbtPlugin(\"io.spray\" % \"sbt-revolver\" % “x.y.z\")\n\nChange x.y.z to latest version from its GitHub repository. \nMain feature of sbt-reolver is \"triggered execution\" upon project file modification. \nIt helps to restart your application automatically and may remind\nyou dynamic-language experience where developers test their modules by refreshing a browser page or by calling their scripts again.\n\n\nIn summary, it enables a super-fast development turnaround for your Scala applications.\nSBT Reolver starts your application in forked JVM, that helps to easily pass JVM options and restart it again upon triggered execution.\n\n\nMainExchange is my Scala application started by sbt-revolver as separate JVM process.\nRevolver has its own configuration to control JVM options, environment variables, etc.\nJVM options example:\njavaOptions in reStart += \"-Xmx2g\"\n\nSet your main class. It is useful when you have more than one:\nmainClass in reStart := Some(\"com.example.Main\")\n\nEnable debug of the forked JVM process:\nRevolver.enableDebugging(port = 5050, suspend = true)\n\nExport environment variables for your Scala application:\nenvVars in reStart := Map(“K8S_NAMESPACE\" -&gt; “test\")\n\nBelow is an example of starting an application via sbt-revolver:\n\n\nMainExchange is Akka-HTTP based application running HTTP server. Now let us change some line of code in the code base.\nOnce we done that, sbt-revolver immediately triggers compilation, stop running process and starts new one:\n\n\nThere are 3 things happened:\n\nBuild triggered (compilation)\nStop running application\nStart new application\n\nrestart revolver SBT task is leveraging SBT triggered execution which is enabled by tilde ~ in front the task name,\nwhen running it in SBT shell.\nThere are other useful commands to be combined with ~ to trigger some task upon files modification:\n// runs failed tests, if any\n~ testQuick\n\n// runs specific test\n~ testOnly org.alexeyn.SomeTest\n\n// runs all tests\n~ test\n\n// cleans compiled sources and runs all tests\n~ clean; test\nSBT Tpolecat\nEnables Scala compiler options as per recommendations of Rob Norris blog-post. Plugin enables as many Scala compiler options as possible to enforce type safety and\ndiscourage bad practises in the code base by turning warnings into compiler errors.\nAdd plugin to your project:\naddSbtPlugin(“io.github.davidgregory084\" % \"sbt-tpolecat\" % “0.1.10\")\n\nActually, the same compiler options can be enabled manually within the SBT definition. However, it is more convenient to\nenable this plugin once and forget about adding anything manually. One can also disable particular options enabled by this\nplugin, in case that option does not make sense for particular project.\nSome of the options which are enabled by this plugin:\nscalacOptions ++= Seq(\n \"-deprecation\",               \n \"-encoding\", \"utf-8\",         \n \"-explaintypes\",                  \n \"-language:higherKinds\",          \n \"-language:implicitConversions\",  \n \"-unchecked\",                       \n \"-Xfatal-warnings\",            \n \"-Xlint:infer-any\",                 \n \"-Ywarn-dead-code\",              \n \"-Ywarn-extra-implicit\",        \n \"-Ywarn-inaccessible\",          \n \"-Ywarn-infer-any\",            \n \"-Ywarn-numeric-widen\",       \n \"-Ywarn-unused:implicits\",   \n \"-Ywarn-unused:imports\",     \n \"-Ywarn-unused:locals\",     \n \"-Ywarn-unused:params\",     \n \"-Ywarn-unused:patvars\",    \n \"-Ywarn-unused:privates\",   \n \"-Ywarn-value-discard\"     \n…    \n)\n\nLast time I checked this plugin it enables 54 scalac options. I recommend to use this plugin by default in every project, it will\nmake your code base much more robust.\nSBT Native Packager\nTo enbale in your project:\naddSbtPlugin(\"com.typesafe.sbt\" %% \"sbt-native-packager\" % “x.y.z\")\n\nNative Packager allows to package your application in different formats such as:\n\nuniversal&nbsp;zip, tar.gz,&nbsp;xz&nbsp;archives\ndeb&nbsp;and&nbsp;rpm&nbsp;packages\ndmg&nbsp;\nmsi&nbsp;\nDocker\nGraalVM&nbsp;native images\n\nNative packager is not auto-plugin, i.e. it is not enabled by default. In order to use it for some of\nyour module, you need to enable it in SBT definition:\nlazy val root = (project in file(\".\")).\n  settings(\n    name := \"exchange\",\n    ….\n    dockerBaseImage := “openjdk:8-jre-alpine”,\n    dockerExposedPorts ++= Seq(8080),\n    dockerRepository := Some(“alexeyn\")\n  ).enablePlugins(AshScriptPlugin) \n                          // or other options - DockerPlugin, JavaAppPackaging\n\nThis plugins comes with different types of packaging format, which you can choose when enabling it for some SBT module.\nIn the example above, we enable Java packaging format with Ash shell compatible executable script, so that we can run a JAR file\nin Alpine Linux. Basically, JavaAppPackaging is a base format. It creats a couple of scripts to start JVM with a long list \nof JAR files in the CLASSPATH variable. It also puts all required dependencies into the lib folder, \nwhich is referenced from that automatically generated shell script. \nJava Packaging Format\nBelow an example of such SBT task.

It is usually done, when image build is designed as separate step in CI pipeline.\nSBT Release\nSBT Release provides customisable release process. It helps to manage your project version, publish project artefacts to configured \nrepository. \naddSbtPlugin(\"com.github.gseitz\" % \"sbt-release\" % “1.0.12\")\n\nTypical Scala project release process may include:\n\n\nYou can script all typical tasks to perform version increase, creating Git tag, building an image, publishing\na JAR file to central artefact repository, etc. SBT Release gives a list of predefined tasks, which we\ncan use as is or customise to fulfil project needs.\nDefault list of release steps is:\nreleaseProcess := Seq[ReleaseStep](\n    checkSnapshotDependencies,\n    inquireVersions,\n    runTest,\n    setReleaseVersion,\n    commitReleaseVersion,\n    tagRelease, \n    publishArtifacts,\n    inquireVersions, \n    setNextVersion, \n    commitNextVersion, \n    pushChanges  \n)\n\nDefault list can be good enough for typical Scala project. You do not need to define it in SBT build file if you are fine\nwith it.\nIn order to run SBT tasks to release with default steps, one can run:\nsbt 'release with-defaults'\n\nSome of the steps are responsible for project version management. Project version is usually located in project root folder and named\nas version.sbt file. \nIn case we have such version in the file: \nversion in ThisBuild := \"0.1.1-SNAPSHOT\"\n\nthen\n\ninquireVersions step will read it \nsetReleaseVersion step will make as release version\n\nversion in ThisBuild := “0.1.1\"\n\n\nsetNextVersion step will switch release version to next snapshot version\n\nversion in ThisBuild := “0.1.2-SNAPSHOT\"\n\nVersion increment can be customised, so that you can control which number is incremented: patch, minor or major version.\nThere are steps to commit and push changes, typically placed at the end of the process. \nIf we look at Git log after release is executed, then we will see that sbt-release is making a couple of commits to reflect\nthe release process in Git commit history.\nLatest message on top:\ncommit 99b1094dce14bf99b6f38a8ff9870edaf7c728d3 (HEAD -&gt; master, origin/master)\nDate:   Fri Feb 7 09:20:03 2020 +0100\n\n    Setting version to 0.1.2-SNAPSHOT\n\ncommit cb9ec293a11a5f6d989c936b18922d3f3ec40bcd (tag: v0.2.2)\nDate:   Fri Feb 7 09:16:59 2020 +0100\n\n    Setting version to 0.1.1\n\ncommit 63abea7141901419ad732d354dc703f884e53010\nMerge: b180810 a1c0c14\nDate:   Fri Feb 7 08:57:00 2020 +0100\n\n    Merge pull request #35 from novakov-alexey/add-cookier-attributes\n    add string property attributes to put user defined parameters into th…\nOther useful plugins\nThere are many other useful plugins I usually use from project to project:\n\nsbt-updates to report newest versions of the libraries inlucluded in your project.\nsbt-scalafmt to format Scala code.\nsbt-mdoc to compile Scala code snippets in the Markdown documentation. Useful for own Scala libraries.\nsbt-scoverage to report test coverage in the project.\n\nSummary\nSBT has become quite mature build tool. It offers good variety of plugins for every day life of Scala developer.\nIf you cannot find specific SBT plugin that fits your requirements, you can try to implement it using SBT Tasks and Plugin API. \nThen it could be published as open source project. This is how many SBT plugins were born.\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/sbt-plugins/","title":"SBT Plugins"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-ce-timeout/":{"body":"\n\nSometimes Scala developer needs to call external program, which is running outside of the JVM. \nIn this case, we use scala.sys.process package. Process package has bunch of functions to spin up new processes, \nconsume their outputs and errors. Also, spawned process can be stopped. Usually, we run external programs for a short period\nof time to make some side-effect. Then, we analyse its exit code to apply some error handling logic in our main Scala program.\nIt worth to say that process API is blocking execution thread, when we are waiting for its completion. To summarise, Scala\ndeveloper wants to do the following:\n\n\nStart external program as a process by giving a string containing command to be executed in underlying operating system.\nWait for completion and get the exit code.\nCancel spawned process, in case waiting time for its completion is greater than a certain threshold.\n\nGood news, we can do all of that in Cats-Effect leveraging IO monad to handle a side-effect and having timeout logic around.\nHandle blocking code\nBesides usual ContextShift, we will use separate thread pool to run blocking code of process API.\nCats-Effect provides Blocker class to evaluate specific IO on a given execution context. In case below, we are going\nto use CachedThreadPool, which can grow almost infinitely. Our main execution context will be still ExecutionContext.global\nand it will be used for non-blocking operations.\n\nimport java.util.concurrent.Executors\nimport java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException\n\nimport cats.effect.ExitCase._\nimport cats.effect.{Blocker, Concurrent, ContextShift, IO, Timer}\nimport cats.implicits._\n\nimport scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext\nimport scala.concurrent.duration._\nimport scala.sys.process._\n\nimplicit val timer: Timer[IO] = IO.timer(ExecutionContext.global)\nimplicit val cs: ContextShift[IO] = IO.contextShift(ExecutionContext.global)\n\nval cachedThreadPool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool()\nval blocker = Blocker.liftExecutionContext(\n    ExecutionContext.fromExecutor(cachedThreadPool)\n)\n\nBlocking Task\nBlocker has blockOn method, which takes an IO and returns an IO to be evaluated on the specified earlier thread pool.\ndef startProcess(cmd: String): IO[Int] = {\n  val blockingTask = blocker.blockOn(IO(cmd.run()))\n\n  //.... tbd\n}\n\n\nUsing Cats-Effect Bracket type class we can safely start our\nprocess and handle its IO cancelation. On task cancel event, we are going to call Process#destroy method to stop running in OS.\ndef startProcess(cmd: String): IO[Int] = {\n  val blockingTask = blocker.blockOn(IO(cmd.run()))\n  blockingTask.bracketCase { p =&gt;\n    IO(p.exitValue())\n  } { (p, exit) =&gt;\n    exit match {\n      case Completed =&gt; IO.unit\n      case Error(_) | Canceled =&gt; IO(p.destroy())\n    }\n  }\n} \n\nAbove pattern matching case on Canceled, we stop process p using destroy().\nRun a task with timeout\nOne of the way to run Cats IO with timeout is to use its race method from Concurrent type class. Second\ntask in race is a call of Timer#sleep, which is semantically blocking an IO for a specified duration.\nLet's bring special function to start a race for two IOs and have third task as fallback IO, in case first IO\nwas not completed before timeout. Below function was reused from Cats-Effect documentation:\ndef timeoutTo[F[_], A](\n    fa: F[A],\n    after: FiniteDuration,\n    fallback: F[A]\n  )(implicit timer: Timer[F], concurrent: Concurrent[F]): F[A] = {\n\n    concurrent.race(fa, timer.sleep(after)).flatMap {\n      case Left(a) =&gt;\n        println(\"Done\")\n        concurrent.pure(a)\n      case Right(_) =&gt;\n        println(\"Timeout\")\n        fallback\n    }\n  }\n\nNow we are ready to run our blocking task with timeout. For the sake of example, we set 1 second as timeout and failing returned IO,\nby giving fallback IO with exception. Let us run infinitely running command such tail -f on some file to simulate \nlong-running task, which we need to cancel in case of timeout.\nval task = startProcess(\"tail -f build.sbt\")\nval finalTask = timeoutTo(task, 1.second, \n  IO.raiseError(new TimeoutException(\"Failed to run external process\")))\nfinalTask.unsafeRunSync()\n\nOutput\nscala&gt; finalTask.unsafeRunSync()\n          //... here comes a content of build.sbt as per given command \n  \nTimeout\njava.util.concurrent.TimeoutException: Failed to run external process\n\nHappy case:\nscala&gt; val task = startProcess(\"echo cats\")\nscala&gt; val finalTask = timeoutTo(task, 1.second, \n  IO.raiseError(new TimeoutException(\"Failed to run externall process\")))\nscala&gt; finalTask.unsafeRunSync()\ncats\nDone\nres3: Int = 0\nSummary\n\nUsing Bracket we can easily catch IO cancelation and release acquired resource. \nIn the example above, we destroy external process, so that OS resource is released. \nCats Blocker helps us to run blocking tasks safely with regards\nto other non-blocking tasks. \nAnd IO.race can be used to simulate timeout, since it cancels race looser.\n\nMisc\nPhoto by Maico Amorim on Unsplash","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-ce-timeout/","title":"Cats-Effect: Cancel Scala Process on Timeout"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-fs2/":{"body":"Recently, I ran into a familiar situation by doing data processing, where I needed to deal with a fragmented data stream. Having fragments, I had to detect manually where exactly new line/message starts and where current line/message ends in the stream. As turned out, one can aggregate intermediate state of the fragmented stream using scan function.\nLet us dig down into how scan function is working.\n\n\nScan function\nFS2 Stream Scan combinator works similar to scan function in Scala collection library. Official Scala doc for scan:\ndef scan[B &gt;: A, That](z: B)(op: (B, B) ⇒ B)(\n    implicit cbf: CanBuildFrom[List[A], B, That]\n): That\n\nsays:\n\n  Computes a prefix scan of the elements of the collection.\n  \n  -- Scala doc\n  \n\nHm, what this would mean? It is much easier to try it and see how it works.\nHere is visual diagram for scan:\n\nLet’s try with simple List using Scala REPL.\n\nIf we just aggregate and return acc every time in op function:\n\n&gt; val l = List(\"I\", \"am\", \"broken\", \"sentence\")\nl: List[String] = List(\"I\", \"am\", \"broken\", \"sentence\"\n\n&gt; l.scan(\"\"){case (acc, e) =&gt; acc + \" \" +  e}\nres5: List[String] = \nList(\"\", \" I\", \" I am\", \" I am broken\", \" I am broken sentence\")\n\n\nIf we apply some if condition based on the element content, then we can control, which element is going to be added into output collection:\n\n&gt; l.scan(\"\"){\n  case (acc, e) =&gt; if (e == \"broken\") e else  acc + \" \" +  e\n}\n\nres6: List[String] = \nList(\"\", \" I\", \" I am\", \"broken\", \"broken sentence\")\n\nAs we can see, once boolean condition in the if is true, we return only the current element e and start new accumulation, i.e. produce next element without all the stuff we accumulated before. Hopefully, these two examples help to grasp an idea of the scan function.\nCSV file processing using FS2\nLet’s first create a Scala IOApp using cats-effect library, which is coming as FS2 dependency, and define FS2 blocking execution context to work with files.\nimport java.nio.file.Paths\nimport java.util.concurrent.Executors\nimport cats.effect.{ExitCode, IO, IOApp, Resource}\nimport cats.instances.int._\nimport cats.syntax.all._\nimport fs2._\n\nobject Main extends IOApp {\n  val Separator = \";\"\n  val isNextId: Regex = s\"^(\\\\s*\\\\d+.*)$Separator\".r\n  val LastRowPaddingId = s\"1$Separator\"\n  val ColumnsInFile = 10\n  val HeaderLines = 1  \n  \n  override def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] =\n    processFile(\"./input.csv\").compile.drain.as(ExitCode.Success)  \n    \n  private val blockingExecutionContext =\n    Resource.make(IO(\n        ExecutionContext\n          .fromExecutorService(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2))\n        ))(ec =&gt; IO(ec.shutdown()))  \n        \n  private def processFile(filePath: String): Stream[IO, Unit] = ???\n}\n\nAbove processFile function will be returning a stream taking a file path to be processed as CSV file.\nprocessFile implementation:\nStream.resource(blockingExecutionContext).flatMap { blockingEC =&gt;\n  io.file\n    .readAll[IO](Paths.get(filePath), blockingEC, 4 * 4096)\n    .through(text.utf8Decode)\n    .append(Stream.eval(IO.pure(\"\\n\" + LastRowPaddingId)))\n    .through(text.lines)\n    .drop(HeaderLines)\n    .scan((\"\", \"\")) {\n      case ((acc, _), line) =&gt; concatBrokenLines(acc, line)\n    }\n    .filter { case (_, line) =&gt; line.trim.nonEmpty }\n    .map { case (_, line) =&gt; line.split(Separator, ColumnsInFile) }\n    .map(processRow)\n    .foldMap(_ =&gt; 1)\n    .map(n =&gt; println(s\"Processed $n record(s)\"))\n}\n\nThe main code of finding the complete CSV line (a line, which can have multiple parts of one logical CSV line separated by line brakes like \\n) starts at line:\n.scan((\"\", \"\")) {\n  case ((acc, _), line) =&gt; concatBrokenLines(acc, line)\n}\n.filter { case (_, line) =&gt; line.trim.nonEmpty }\n\nInside the scan function, we delegate ‘op’ part to concatBrokenLine function:\ndef concatBrokenLines(acc: String, line: String) = {  \n  // next line detected, i.e. we flush `acc` downstream,\n  // since it already contains a complete line to be processed\n  if (isNextId.findFirstIn(acc).isDefined \n      &amp;&amp; isNextId.findFirstIn(line).isDefined) (line, acc)\n  \n  // next line is not yet detected, i.e. we flush an empty string \n  // and append current line to the current `acc` state  \n  else (acc + \" \" + line, \"\")\n}\n\nusing regular expression isNextId we identify, whether new line marker is found. In the regular expression we want to find a number following by semicolon (according to current file business logic).\nRead the inline comments in the concatBrokenLines function on how using if/else logic, we control what needs to be put into next element of the downstream. As you can see, we use second half of the accumulator to push the complete line further (in the if branch).\nNow looking at scan and its concatBrokenLines function together, we can summarise:\nwe process CSV lines by folding them via scan function using empty element as a tuple of two empty strings (“”, “”). In the head of the scanning lambda we use only first part of the zero element, we call it acc, i.e. accumulator. We also have line variable, which is given by the Stream.scan function itself. Then, we delegate the decision on what needs to be returned to the downstream using filter function. Basically, we use filter as a guard to control what actually needs to be passed further for the main processing logic as CVS line.\nAlso, we append fake line to be able to process the very last line. This last line needs one more marker to be properly detected as complete line:\n.append(Stream.eval(IO.pure(\"\\n\" + LastRowPaddingId)))\nTest of the FS2 code\nUsing file input.csv:\nindex;City;population\n1;Berlin is the\ncapital and largest city of\nGermany by\nboth area and population.;3,748,148\n1;Madrid is the capital of Spain and the largest\nmunicipality in both the Community of Madrid and Spain as\na whole.;3,223,334\n1;Donetsk former names: Aleksandrovka,\nHughesovka, Yuzovka, Stalino is an industrial city in Ukraine on the Kalmius\nRiver.;929,063\n\nwe print the resulted lines of the stream in the processRow function. In real life this function supposed to do something useful:\nprivate def processRow(columns: Array[String]): Unit = \n  println(s\"processed: ${columns.mkString(\" :: \").trim}\")\n\nOutput:\nprocessed: 1 :: Berlin is the capital and largest city of Germany by both area and population. :: 3,748,148\nprocessed: 1 :: Madrid is the capital of Spain and the largest municipality in both the Community of Madrid and Spain as a whole. :: 3,223,334\nprocessed: 1 :: Donetsk former names: Aleksandrovka, Hughesovka, Yuzovka, Stalino is an industrial city in Ukraine on the Kalmius River. :: 929,063\nProcessed 3 record(s)\nSummary\nApplying knowledge of functional combinators, we have gotten concise and clean code, without using any global mutable state outside of the stream definition. We have also solved the problem within the single data stream using scan to aggregate intermediate state and filter function as a guard to discard incomplete CSV lines.\nFS2 library is very nice and especially having Cats and Cats-effect as direct dependency. \nSee more examples for functional streaming in FS2 guide\nSource code: https://github.com/novakov-alexey/fs2-csv-scan\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-fs2/","title":"Scala FS2 - handle broken CSV lines"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-monads/":{"body":"Once you start dig deeper into Scala and its suitability for functional programming, you meet Monads. In this blog post, we will explore Monads in Scala:\ntheir usage and usefulness. \n\n\nWhat is Monad?\nYou have probably already heard this quote:\n\n  A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors\n  \n  -- Saunders Mac Lane\n  \n\nMore details on StackOverflow answer\nWell, that does not bring much help. Obviously, Monad is not just Scala pattern, but it is something what is coming \nfrom Category Theory. \nHowever, we are not going to touch Category Theory in general, but let's say that Monad definition is coming from abstract theory of Mathematics.\nI like another definition of Monad, which is given in the  book \"Functional Programming in Scala\":\n\n  Monad is an abstract interface\n  \n  -- Chiusano, Bjarnason\n  \n\nIt is more clear for programmers. Before we clarify in details what Monad is, let us look at some examples of Mondas in Scala standard library.\nThis might already click for you that Monad is not something from aliens:\n\nOption\nEither\nList\nFuture\nMap\nSet\nStream\nVector\nTry \n\n... and others\nWhat makes thing a Monad?\nThere are several minimum combinations of functions which make some type a Monad. One of the popular minimum set is two functions:\n\nflatMap - also known as bind\nunit - also known as pure in Cats library or apply in pure Scala\n\nThese two functions implemented for some type bring powerful abstraction to write complex programs easy.\nMake your Monad\nMonad sometimes reminds a container to work with its values using special interface. If we model Monad ourselves, then it may look like a box with a thing\ninside, which we access using flatMap and one more useful function map:\nclass Box[A](v: A) { \n\n  def flatMap[B](f: A =&gt; Box[B]): Box[B] = f(v)\n  \n  def map[B](f: A =&gt; B): Box[B] = flatMap(a =&gt; new Box(f(a)))\n}\n\nmap - is implemented in terms of flatMap + unit (i.e. Box class constructor). \nSo we can implement map for any kind of Monads, as we will see that later.\nNow let's use Box  Monad to show some usage example:\nscala&gt; new Box(1)\nres2: Box[Int] = 1\n\nscala&gt; res2.map(_ + 1)\nres3: Box[Int] = 2\n\nscala&gt; res3.flatMap(i =&gt; new Box(1 + i))\nres5: Box[Int] = 3\n\nBox contains single integer value and allows us to manipulate it without leaving Box context, i.e. our result is always a Box[T].\nWe can also make variable v as public and read it when needed. Box behaves similarly to non-empty single element list.\nIt is hard to say when this particular Box Monad will be useful looking at above example. However, it should give you an idea how Monad implementation may look like.\nScala Examples\nList\nList operates on collection of values. \nscala&gt; val l = List(1,2,3) // &lt;-- unit\nl: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)\n\nscala&gt; l.map(_ + 1)\nres0: List[Int] = List(2, 3, 4)\n\nscala&gt; l.flatMap(i =&gt; List(i + 1))\nres1: List[Int] = List(2, 3, 4)\n\nOption\nOption has two sub-types: Some and None. \nSome is like non-empty single element list, similar to Box Monad example above.\nNone ignores application of lambda function in flatMap or map.\nval isOn = Some(1) // &lt;-- unit\nval isBlack = None // &lt;-- unit without any argument\n\ndef makeCoffee: Option[String] = Some(1)\n\nscala&gt; isOn\n         .flatMap(_ =&gt; isBlack\n         .flatMap(_ =&gt; makeCoffee))\n\nres0: Option[String] = None\n\nExample above won't return value of isOn variable because the first flatMap call returns None because of isBlack, so that second flatMap even won't be called.\nGeneric Monad\nWe have already seen example of at least 3 Monads above. In order to detach definition of Monad from its concrete implementation like\nList or Option, let us define abstract Monad interface using Scala high-order types feature:\n  trait Monad[F[_]] extends Functor[F] {\n    def unit[A](a: =&gt; A): F[A]\n\n    def flatMap[A,B](ma: F[A])(f: A =&gt; F[B]): F[B]\n\n    def map[A,B](ma: F[A])(f: A =&gt; B): F[B] = \n      flatMap(ma)(a =&gt; unit(f(a))) \n  }\n\n  trait Functor[F[_]] {\n    def map[A,B](fa: F[A])(f: A =&gt; B): F[B]\n  }\n\nFunctor is one more abstraction which is more simpler than Monad. It requires only map implementation. We can say that every Monad also a Functor. \nFunctor is also coming from the Category Theory. I decided to mention it here, because you will frequently find it in the context of Monads,\nwhen learning functional programming in general. Abstract Monad interface can also implement map in terms of flatMap and unit functions, \nso that map is implemented automatically for any concrete implementation of some Monad.\nFunction application in flatMap\nAn application of f function in flatMap and map depends on the concrete Monad instance. In one case the lambda\nfunction we pass to the flatMap is always executed, in another cases not. Examples:\n\"f\" applied when:\n\nOption[A]: is Some(A)\nEither[A, B]: is Right(B)\nList[A]: is non-empty\nFuture[A]: is ready\n\nEven though flatMap behaves differently on concrete Monad instance, there is still great benefits to use them in any ordinary program.\nIn order to classify some type as a Monad, it needs to comply with Monad Laws and that is closing the definition of Monads. Let's look \nat Monad laws before we move further to practical examples.\nMonad Laws\n1. Identity\nResult of a function which creates Monad instance using unit is equal to application of this function over already created Monad instance.\nExample:\ndef f(x: Int): Option[Int] = Some(x)\n\nscala&gt; Some(1).flatMap(f) == f(1)\nres0: Boolean = true\n\nscala&gt; f(1) == Some(1).flatMap(f)\nres1: Boolean = true\n\nAbstract definition of Identity Law:\n1.1 Left identity\ndef f[A](x: A): Monad[A] = unit(x)\n\nflatMap(unit(x))(f) == f(x) \n1.2 Right identity\nf(x) == flatMap(unit(x))(f)\n2. Associative\nApplication of f1 and f2 functions one after another yields the same result as applying them within the first flatMap.\nExample:\ndef f1(a: Int): Option[Int] = Some(a + 1)\ndef f2(a: Int): Option[Int] = Some(a * 2)\n\nscala&gt; Some(1).flatMap(f1).flatMap(f2)\nres0: Option[Int] = Some(4)\n\nscala&gt; Some(1).flatMap(a =&gt; f1(a).flatMap(f2))\nres1: Option[Int] = Some(4)\n\nAbstract definition:\ndef f1[A](a: A): Monad[A]\ndef f2[A](a: A): Monad[A]\n\nif x is a Monad instance,\n\nflatMap(flatMap(x)(f1))(f2) == flatMap(x)(a =&gt; flatMap(f1(a))(f2))\nFunctor Laws\n1. Identity\nExample:\nmap(Some(1))(a =&gt; a) == Some(1)\n\nAbstract definition:\nmap(x)(a =&gt; a) == x  // the same value returned\n2. Associative\nExample:\nval f1 = (n: Int) =&gt; n + 1\nval f2 = (n: Int) =&gt; n * 2\n\nmap(map(Some(1))(f1))(f2) // Some(4)\n            == \nmap(Some(1))(f2 compose f1) // Some(4)\n\nStandard Scala function compose return a function which applies f1 and then f2 taking the result of the first f1 function.\nAbstract definition:\nmap(map(x)(f1))(f2) == map(x)(f2 compose f1) \nApplication of Monads\nUsing Monads we can do sequential composition. If we have several values in form of Option, we can sequence them into logic program,\nwhich evaluates next value based on the flatMap behaviour of the previous value. \nCompose Option\nfinal case class Coffee(name: String)\n\nval isOn = Some(1)\nval coffeeName = Some(\"black\")\nval makeCoffee = (name: String) =&gt; Some(Coffee(name))\n\nfor {\n  _ &lt;- isOn\n  name &lt;- coffeeName\n  coffee &lt;- makeCoffee(name)\n} yield coffee\n\nscala&gt; Option[Coffee] = Some(Coffee(black))\n\nFinal result of this program is Some(..) value. However, it could result into None, if one these three values is None.\nCompose Either\nThe following three functions return Either Monad, so that we can compose them into a sequence.\ncase class Cluster(pods: Int)\n\ndef validateNamespace(ns: String): Either[String, Unit] = Right(())\ndef clusterExists(ns: String): Either[Cluster, Unit] = Right(())\ndef createCluster(ns: String, cluster: Cluster): Either[String, Cluster] = \n  Right(Cluster(cluster.pods))\n\nWe can compose them in same manner as we have done with Option example above:\nval ns = \"my-cluster\"\nfor {\n   _ &lt;- validateNamespace(ns)\n   _ &lt;- clusterExists(ns).left.map(c =&gt; \n           s\"Cluster with ${c.pods} pods already exists\")\n   newCluster &lt;- createCluster(ns, Cluster(4))\n} yield newCluster\n\nFrom business logic perspective we want to create some hypothetical cluster if namespace is valid and cluster for the given namespace does not exist. \nWe implemented errors as Either.Left and normal result as Either.Right. Interface like Either is a popular approach not only in Scala to have some sort of result wrapper\nfor normal and error results.\nFinal result value is based on the return values we hardcoded in the given functions:\nscala&gt; Either[String,Cluster] = Right(Cluster(4))\n\nBenefits of using Monads is that we do not need to use if/else control flow, since we have Monads Laws working when we compose Monad instances.\nIn case some of the given function returns Either.Left, for example:\ndef validNamespace(ns: String): Either[String, Unit] = \n   if (ns == \"my-cluster\") \n   Left(\n     “Cluster namespace is not valid name, choose another name”\n   ) else Right(())\n\nThen it turns the whole result of the composition into error state, i.e. into Either.Left:\nscala&gt; Either[String,Cluster] = Left(\n              Cluster namespace is not valid name, choose another name\n            )\nFor comprehension\nScala offers special syntax for the sequence of nested flatMap calls and one map at the end, which is called \"for-comprehension\".\nfor {…} yield is a syntactic sugar for a sequence of calls:\nflatMap1(… + flatMapN(.. + map(…)))\n\nDesugared version:\nBehind the scene, Scala compiler desugars the for-comprehension into the following code:\nvalidNamespace(\"my-cluster\")\n  .flatMap(_ =&gt;\n     clusterExists(ns)\n       .left\n       .map(c =&gt; s\"Cluster with ${c.pods} pods already exists\")\n       .flatMap(_ =&gt;\n            createCluster(ns, Cluster(4))\n               .map(newCluster =&gt; newCluster)\n        )\n  )\n\nSugared version of the same code snippet:\nfor {\n  _ &lt;- validNamespace(\"my-cluster\")\n  _ &lt;- clusterExists(ns).left.map(c =&gt; \n          s\"Cluster with ${c.pods} pods already exists\")\n  newCluster &lt;- createCluster(ns, Cluster(4))\n} yield newCluster\n\nFor-comprehension of this program is much more readable and thus recommended to be used when composing monadic values in particular programs.\nCaveat with Monads\n\n\nWe can easily compose Monads of the same types, like we have seen in examples, all values were options or eithers and so on. \nHowever, it is not straightforward to compose different Monad stacks, like Option and Either values in one sequence.\nLet's look at the example of such problem below.\nProblem\nLet's make one of the value in the for-comprehension to be different type, so that we will try to compose different Monads:\ndef validateNamespace(ns: String): \n    Either[String, Unit]\n\ndef clusterExists(ns: String): \n    Option[Either[String, Cluster]] //Attention &lt;-- two Monad layers\n\ndef createCluster(ns: String, cluster: Cluster): \n    Either[String, Cluster] \n\nIf we try to compile below code:\nfor {\n  _ &lt;- validateNamespace(ns)\n  cluster &lt;- clusterExists(ns)\n  updated &lt;- createCluster(ns, cluster)\n} yield  updated\n\nThis is going to end up in compiler errors:\nupdated &lt;- createCluster(ns, cluster)\n                             ^\n&lt;pastie&gt;:4: error: type mismatch;\n found   : Either[String,Cluster]\n required: Cluster\n\n    cluster &lt;- clusterExists(ns)\n            ^\n&lt;pastie&gt;:3: error: type mismatch;\n found   : Option[Nothing]\n required: scala.util.Either[?,?]\nOption[Nothing] &lt;: scala.util.Either[?,?]?\nfalse\n\nFirst Monadic value rules them all. \nOnce we put first value such as validateNamespace, which returns Either[_, _], it starts\nto drive the return type of the flatMap function. Second nested value is not Either type, but Option[_]. Here it starts to brake\nthe Monad interface and eventually won't let it compile the code. What we need is to align monadic values to common ground.\nMonad Transformer\nIn order to compose different Monad types, we can use one more pattern called Monad Transformer.\nMonad Transformer is a custom-written Monad designed specifically for composition. Of course we could tackle above problem\nby unboxing Option, then checking what is in the Either, return Either again to make for-comprehension to be compiled. However, \nthis would be clumsy and not scalable solution in terms of code maintenance. Monad Transformers example:\n\nOptionT to compose Option + Any other Monad\nEitherT to compose Either + Any other Monad\nReaderT to compose Reader + Any other Monad\nWriterT to compose Writer + Any other Monad\n... others\n\nIf we want to compose Option Monad with other monadic values of type Either, then we need to use EitherT monad for Option.\nEitherT instance knows how to unbox and box Option to operate on nested Either and thus guide the flatMap function.\nLet us look at EitherT example implementation taken from Cats library:\n// takes 3 type parameters: \n// 1. high-order type of the outer Monad \n// 2. left type of Either\n// 3. right type of Either\nfinal case class EitherT[F[_], A, B](value: F[Either[A, B]]) {\n\n def flatMap[AA &gt;: A, D](f: B =&gt; EitherT[F, AA, D])(implicit F: Monad[F])\n   : EitherT[F, AA, D] =\n   // Attention: there is one more \"flatMap\" to unwrap first Monad layer,\n   // which is F[_] \n   EitherT(F.flatMap(value) { \n     case l @ Left(_) =&gt; F.pure(l.rightCast)\n     case Right(b)    =&gt; f(b).value\n   })\n}\n\nSee inline comments above. One more important point is that we expect an implicit Monad instance for that outer Monad \nF[_]. We use it to unwrap first Monad, by convention this variable is also named F. \nSo Monad Transformer does not do any magic, but it is just a type constructor, which returns a Monad as result. \nApply Monad Transformer\nNow let us use the same example and define return values:\ncase class Cluster(pods: Int, updated: Long)\n\ndef validateNamespace(ns: String): Either[String, Unit] = \n  Right(())\n\ndef clusterExists(ns: String): Option[Either[String, Cluster]] =\n  Some(Right(Cluster(3, System.currentTimeMillis())))\n\ndef updateCluster(ns: String, cluster: Cluster): \n  Either[String, Cluster] =\n  Right(Cluster(cluster.pods, System.currentTimeMillis()))\n\nWe are going to use EitherT instance from Cats library.\nimport cats.implicits._\nimport cats.data.EitherT\n\nval cluster = for {\n    _ &lt;- validateNamespace(ns).toEitherT[Option]\n    cluster&lt;- EitherT(clusterExists(ns))\n    updated &lt;- updateCluster(ns, cluster).toEitherT[Option]\n} yield  updated\n\nSince we introduced Monad transformer into composition, we have to use it for all the monadic values in the same sequence of flatMaps.\nSo, we have to wrap first value and third value into EitherT as well using extension method to EitherT.\nIn the result we have two layers of Monads too. First Option, then Either:\nscala&gt; cluster.value\nSome(Right(Cluster(3,1583095558496)))\n\nAlternative case, when some of the statement in composition yields an error value:\n// we return Left value this time\ndef clusterExists(ns: String): Option[Either[String, Cluster]] =\n    Left(\"Cluster is invalid\").some\n\nscala&gt; cluster.value\nres4: Option[Either[String,Cluster]] = Some(Left(Cluster is invalid))\n\nIn the result, our composition stopped on the second statement. clusterExists returns Some(Left(...)), so that \nEitherT could detect that Either.Left is end of the journey and entire composition ended on Left even it is wrapped into Some.\nBasically, Monad transformer looks into two layers one by one, when chaining monadic values. This was our goal\nto get a concise program and handle nested monadic value on composition in the same time.\nSummary\nMonad and Monad transformers are useful abstractions in every day life of functional programmer.\nAlthough it may seems like Monad is programming language on its own, it allows us to write programs based on the Laws!!!\nWe can compose different monadic values without using much a control flow. \nIn the result, we get fewer logical errors in the code, better structured programs and \nwhat is more important we get possibility to change programs in future much easier without breaking the entire world.\nNow go and flatMap all the things :-)\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-monads/","title":"Monads in Scala"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/tensorflow-scala/":{"body":"\nTensorFlow Scala is a strongly-typed Scala API for TensorFlow core C++ library developed by Anthony Platanios.

For example:\nimport org.platanios.tensorflow.api._\n\nval t1 = Tensor(Tensor(1, 4, 0), Tensor(2, 3, 5))\nprintln(t1.summarize())\n\nwill print:\nTensor[Int, [2, 3]]\n[[1, 4, 0],\n [2, 3, 5]]\nData Preparation\nTensorFlow Scala also has data API to load datasets. We will use that API \npartly. Unfortunately, current documentation does not give an idea how to use Data API, so that we will use partly. Most of data preparation code I took from previous article.\nCustom Code\ntype Matrix[T] = Array[Array[T]]\n\nprivate def createEncoders[T: Numeric: ClassTag](data: Matrix[String])\n  : Matrix[String] =&gt; Matrix[T] = {\n\n  val encoder = LabelEncoder.fit[String](TextLoader.column(data, 2))\n  val hotEncoder = OneHotEncoder.fit[String, T](TextLoader.column(data, 1))\n\n  val label = t =&gt; encoder.transform(t, 2)\n  val hot = t =&gt; hotEncoder.transform(t, 1)\n  val typeTransform = (t: Matrix[String]) =&gt; transform[T](t)\n\n  label andThen hot andThen typeTransform\n}\n\ndef loadData() = {\n  // loading data from CSV file into memory \n  val loader = TextLoader(Path.of(\"data/Churn_Modelling.csv\")).load()\n  val data = loader.cols[String](3, -1)\n\n  val encoders = createEncoders[Float](data)\n  val numericData = encoders(data)\n  val scaler = StandardScaler[Float]().fit(numericData)\n\n  // create data transformation as custom code\n  val prepareData = (t: Matrix[String]) =&gt; {\n    val numericData = encoders(t)\n    scaler.transform(numericData)\n  }\n\n  // transform features\n  val xMatrix = prepareData(data)    \n  val yVector = loader.col[Float](-1)\n\nTensor API\nContinuation of loadData:\n  import org.platanios.tensorflow.data.utilities.UniformSplit\n  // Wrap arrays into Tensors and set Shapes\n  val xData = xMatrix.map(a =&gt; Tensor(a.toSeq)).toSeq\n  val x = Tensor(xData).reshape(Shape(-1, features))\n  val y = Tensor(yVector.toSeq).reshape(Shape(-1, targets))\n\n  // use library API to split data for train and test sets\n  val split = UniformSplit(x.shape(0), None)\n  val (trainIndices, testIndices) = split(trainPortion = 0.8f)\n  val xTrain = x.gather[Int](trainIndices, axis = 0)\n  val yTrain = y.gather[Int](trainIndices, axis = 0)\n  val xTest = x.gather[Int](testIndices, axis = 0)\n  val yTest = y.gather[Int](testIndices, axis = 0)\n  (xTrain, yTrain, xTest, yTest, prepareData)\n}\n\nAs per comments above, we prepare training and test data and return it as 4\ndifferent Tensor objects. Also, we return a function as fifth element of the tuple\nfor one more application (read further).\nFull code of data preparation that includes:\n\nselecting specific CSV file columns\nnormalising numeric columns\nencoding categorical columns as one-hot \nencoding label-like columns\n\nsee here:\n\nencoders\nTextLoader \n\nModel Assembly\nWe are going to learn on 12 features to predict one target.\nval features = 12\nval targets = 1\nval batchSize = 100\n\nval input = tf.learn.Input(FLOAT32, Shape(-1, features))\nval trainInput = tf.learn.Input(FLOAT32, Shape(-1, targets))\n\nbatchSize will be used in a couple of places of TensorFlow API.\nIn order to construct all 12 x 6 x 6 x 1 network below:\n\n\nwe use the following API:\nval layer =\n  tf.learn.Linear[Float](\"Layer_0/Linear\", 6) &gt;&gt;\n    tf.learn.ReLU[Float](\"Layer_0/ReLU\") &gt;&gt;\n    tf.learn.Linear[Float](\"Layer_1/Linear\", 6) &gt;&gt;\n    tf.learn.ReLU[Float](\"Layer_1/ReLU\") &gt;&gt;\n    tf.learn.Linear[Float](\"OutputLayer/Linear\", 1) &gt;&gt;\n    tf.learn.Sigmoid[Float](\"OutputLayer/Sigmoid\")\n\nlayer state is a composition of fully-connected layers with its own activation function. We specify String name for each layer that will be eventually used in TensorFlow graph.\nval loss = tf.learn.L2Loss[Float, Float](\"Loss/L2Loss\")    \nval optimizer = tf.train.Adam()\n\nWe are going to use L2, which is a half least square error as a loss function.\nAnd Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) as weights optimization algorithm.\nFinally, we pass above values to construct simple supervised model. \nval model = tf.learn.Model.simpleSupervised(\n  input = input,\n  trainInput = trainInput,\n  layer = layer,\n  loss = loss,\n  optimizer = optimizer,\n  clipGradients = ClipGradientsByGlobalNorm(5.0f)\n)\n\nYou can also create unsupervised model with .unsupervised method, if needed.\nAs we can see, model construction is highly declarative as the entire TensorFlow Scala library API.\nEstimator\nAnother abstraction in TensorFlow we are going to use is Estimator. It is used to train, predict, evaluate and export for serving the TensorFlow models. In some other libraries, an estimator is usually a model abstraction itself. Estimator provides nice separation from the input data and actual model to train.\nDataset\nBefore we construct an estimator we need to wrap the input data into a Dataset. As I mentioned before, the TensorFlow Scala provides a data package to \nload some data formats in streaming way / lazily. This is recommended way to use this library that allows us to iterate over the data in streaming fashion, so the full dataset does not need to fit into memory. However, our current example dataset is quite small. so that we used custom code to load and transform the data before we start any learning. Now we have to wrap Tensors into Datasets:\nval (xTrain, yTrain, xTest, yTest, dataTransformer) = loadData()\n\nval trainFeatures = tf.data.datasetFromTensorSlices(xTrain)\nval trainLabels = tf.data.datasetFromTensorSlices(yTrain)\nval testFeatures = tf.data.datasetFromTensorSlices(xTest)\nval testLabels = tf.data.datasetFromTensorSlices(yTest)\n\nval trainData =\n  trainFeatures\n    .zip(trainLabels)\n    .repeat()\n    .shuffle(1000)\n    .batch(batchSize)\n    .prefetch(10)\n\nval evalTrainData = trainFeatures.zip(trainLabels).batch(batchSize).prefetch(10)\nval evalTestData = testFeatures.zip(testLabels).batch(batchSize).prefetch(10)\nOutput\nAbove code creates training dataset as combination of features and labels outputs.\nCore TensorFlow library has an idea of Output abstraction. The Output is a symbolic handle that represents a tensor value produced by an Operation. In other words, it is future state of a Tensor once particular operand is applied to that tensor. It does not hold the values of that operation\noutput, but instead provides a means of computing those values in a TensorFlow Session, which is another TensorFlow abstraction. The session is created automatically by the Estimator. One can also construct TensorFlow session manually, we are not going to do this in this article.\nTraining Metrics\nOne of the place where we work with Outputs directly in this example, is \ntraining metric configuration. For binary classification we need to transform predicted\nvalues by the model to 0 and 1.\nval accMetric = tf.metrics.MapMetric(\n  (v: (Output[Float], (Output[Float], Output[Float]))) =&gt; {\n    val (predicted, (_, actual)) = v\n    val positives = predicted &gt; 0.5f\n    val shape = Shape(batchSize, positives.shape(1))\n    val binary = tf\n      .select(\n        positives,\n        tf.fill(shape)(1f),\n        tf.fill(shape)(0f)\n      )\n    (binary, actual)\n  },\n  tf.metrics.Accuracy(\"Accuracy\")\n)\n\nI think to transform predicted values to binary values, i.e. 1 and 0 can be done more efficient than filling true boolean values with 1 and false values with 0 using tf.select function, but I could not find another way.\nWe will use above accuracy metric in estimator construction.\nConstruct Estimator\nval summariesDir = Paths.get(\"temp/ann\")\n\nval estimator = tf.learn.InMemoryEstimator(\n  model,\n  tf.learn.Configuration(Some(summariesDir)),\n  tf.learn.StopCriteria(maxSteps = Some(100000)),\n  Set(\n    tf.learn.LossLogger(trigger = tf.learn.StepHookTrigger(100)),\n    tf.learn.Evaluator(\n      summaryDir = summariesDir,\n      log = true,\n      datasets = Seq((\"Train\", () =&gt; evalTrainData), (\"Test\", () =&gt; evalTestData)),\n      metrics = Seq(accMetric),\n      trigger = tf.learn.StepHookTrigger(1000),\n      name = \"Evaluator\"\n    ),\n    tf.learn.StepRateLogger(\n      log = false,\n      summaryDir = summariesDir,\n      trigger = tf.learn.StepHookTrigger(100)\n    ),\n    tf.learn.SummarySaver(summariesDir, tf.learn.StepHookTrigger(100)),\n    tf.learn.CheckpointSaver(summariesDir, tf.learn.StepHookTrigger(1000))\n  ),\n  tensorBoardConfig =\n    tf.learn.TensorBoardConfig(summariesDir, reloadInterval = 1)\n)\n\nAbove code configures:\n\nLogging in training loop:\n\nlog to summary directory \"temp/ann\"\nstore checkpoint at every 1000 step to summary directory\nlog at every 100 steps\nlog loss value at every 100 steps\n\n\nEvaluate metrics:\n\ncalculate accuracy metric (and any other specified metrics in Seq) at every 1000 step\nuse data specified in Evaluator datasets\n\n\nTake data for Tensorboard from summary directory\nStop after 100 000 step unless overridden by .train method\n\nNote: estimator works with step notion rather than with epoch. In order to calculate number of desired training steps, you can divide a number training records on batch size. In our case we have 8000 training records / 100 batch size = 80 steps. This is one epoch, i.e. one full training cycle on available dataset. In order to repeat training on the same model parameters 100 times, i.e. 100 epochs instead of 1 epoch we need 80 * 100 = 8000 steps. So if we set 10 000 steps we ask for 125 epochs since 2000 steps is 25 epochs. \nTraining\nestimator.train(\n  () =&gt; trainData,\n  tf.learn.StopCriteria(maxSteps = Some(10000))\n)\n\nFinally we are starting the training loop. We pass the same trainData as we used\nfor metric evaluation. However, we could use different datasets for training and metric evaluations. We override maxSteps with 10 000. As we have only 10k rows in CSV file, we do not need initial 100 000 steps for training. TensorFlow\nOnce we run train method, we can see the following output in console:\n.....\n2021-02-12 19:07:15.308 [run-main-9] INFO  Learn / Hooks / Evaluation - Step 10000 Evaluator:\n2021-02-12 19:07:15.308 [run-main-9] INFO  Learn / Hooks / Evaluation - ╔═══════╤════════════╗\n2021-02-12 19:07:15.308 [run-main-9] INFO  Learn / Hooks / Evaluation - ║       │   Accuracy ║\n2021-02-12 19:07:15.308 [run-main-9] INFO  Learn / Hooks / Evaluation - ╟───────┼────────────╢\n2021-02-12 19:07:15.369 [run-main-9] INFO  Learn / Hooks / Evaluation - ║ Train │     0,8494 ║\n2021-02-12 19:07:15.386 [run-main-9] INFO  Learn / Hooks / Evaluation - ║  Test │     0,8367 ║\n2021-02-12 19:07:15.391 [run-main-9] INFO  Learn / Hooks / Evaluation - ╚═══════╧════════════╝\n\nthere will be 11 logging statements for intermediate accuracy value, so I copied only the last summary.\ntrain method returns Unit, so it mutates state of the estimator, so that you can use\nit further for model inference.\nSingle test\nval example = TextLoader(\n    \"n/a,n/a,n/a,600,France,Male,40,3,60000,2,1,1,50000,n/a\"\n  ).cols[String](3, -1)\nval testExample = Tensor(dataTransformer(example).map(Tensor(_)).toSeq)\n  .reshape(Shape(-1, features))\nval prediction = estimator.infer(() =&gt; testExample)\n\nprintln(s\"Customer exited ? ${prediction.scalar &gt; 0.5f}\")\n\nWe use dataTransformer function one more time for converting raw single data record into\nnumeric format that our model can understand and return a target value for it:\nCustomer exited ? false\n\nfalse is expected value for that simple example.\nBatch test\nWe can also submit data batch to infer a target value for each record.\nprintln(s\"Train accuracy = ${accuracy(xTrain, yTrain)}\")\nprintln(s\"Test accuracy = ${accuracy(xTest, yTest)}\")\n\nWe are going to calculate the accuracy metric manually based on known labels for train and test datasets:\ndef accuracy(input: Tensor[Float], labels: Tensor[Float]): Float = {    \n  val predictions = estimator.infer(() =&gt; input.toFloat).toArray\n  val correct = predictions\n    .map(v =&gt; if (v &gt; 0.5f) 1f else 0f)\n    .zip(labels.toFloat.toArray)\n    .foldLeft(0f) { case (acc, (yHat, y)) =&gt; if (yHat == y) acc + 1 else acc }\n  correct / predictions.length\n}  \nTrain accuracy = 0.867875\nTest accuracy = 0.8605\n\nAlthough we used again the same data for checking accuracy, however one can take new / unseen\ndata to check the accuracy on just trained or loaded from checkpoint estimator.\nTensorboard\nTensorboard is an additional tool from TensorFlow main framework. It can be installed via pip tool:\npip install tensorboard\n\nWe enable Tensorboard as part of Estimator configuration. Every time we run training cycle for an estimator with Tensorboard configured, we get the following console message:\nsbt:tensorflow-scala-example&gt; run\n[info] running MultipleLR\n2021-02-12 21:09:04.933 [run-main-c] INFO  Learn / Hooks / TensorBoard - Launching TensorBoard in 'localhost:6006' for log directory '..../tensorflow-ann/temp/ann'\n\nTensorFlow starts a web-app at localhost on port 6006 and using data from the the log directory that we configured at estimator level.\nLog directory accumulates TensorFlow logs between training cycles, so that if we run training\ncycle again and again we can see that estimator variables (graph state) is restored from that\nlogging folder. Eventually, our model loss and accuracy metric values are going to be stable, i.e. not improving anymore.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nTensorFlow Scala is a fantastic library that mimics most of TensorFlow core library and Python API.\nAlthough current library is missing some documentations, one can always use official TensorFlow documentation web-site to get an idea of the Scala API.\nImplemented ANN in TensorFlow Scala shows that one can use Scala to train Deep Learning models easily. Training program in Scala are going to be quite declarative and statically type-checked which eliminates lots of mistakes. Library API also allows to extend most of the abstractions, which is very important for real life use cases.\nSource Code\nFull source code as SBT project can be found here: \n\nhttps://github.com/novakov-alexey/tensorflow-scala-example\n\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/tensorflow-scala/","title":"TensorFlow Scala - Linear Regression via ANN"}},"docInfo":{"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/adam-optimizer/":{"body":848,"title":4},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/algorithms-max-sum-in-array/":{"body":292,"title":5},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ammonite-kafka/":{"body":676,"title":3},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ann-in-scala-1/":{"body":1833,"title":6},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ann-in-scala-2/":{"body":2568,"title":6},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ann-mnist/":{"body":2244,"title":8},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/aws-saa-exam/":{"body":1242,"title":5},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/cnn-in-scala/":{"body":1082,"title":4},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/cv/":{"body":983,"title":1},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/face-identification/":{"body":1153,"title":4},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/linear-regression/":{"body":985,"title":4},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/presentations/":{"body":137,"title":1},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/sbt-plugins/":{"body":1369,"title":2},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-ce-timeout/":{"body":463,"title":6},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-fs2/":{"body":678,"title":6},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-monads/":{"body":1545,"title":2},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/tensorflow-scala/":{"body":1437,"title":6}},"length":18},"lang":"English"};
